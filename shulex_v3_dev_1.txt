Now I ' m faced with the choice of returning it , or buying a separate micro to mini connector .#### #### ####[]
Yes it is somewhat short but if you have a newer apple laptop this length issue would not be a major problem or more helpful the extra cord that most apple laptop users have anyways then either one could give even more length to the MagSafe charger .#### #### ####[]
Won ‚Äô t work on 3 different new iPhones !#### #### ####[]
It never quite fit right and took a lot of wiggling , shoving , rotating , and finagling to work .#### #### ####[]

For me they did not fit well or comfortably .#### #### ####[]
I spent 60 some dollars on a pair of earbuds just to have them come in uncharged , died in the first couple minutes of trying to test them , and not only that , but without the proper cable that ‚Äô s SUPPOSED to come with it to charge the box that charges the actual earbuds .#### #### ####[]

i had these on for a few hours and i took them out only to realize how much of an echo my room has !#### #### ####[]
I did order the little unit that connects the charge cord to the wall plug .#### #### ####[]
Quality and easy , long lasting charge , as well as comfort and sound quality has made the price almost reasonable , haha .#### #### ####[]
The manual is more thorough than most I ‚Äô ve seen , and pretty clear .#### #### ####[]

They get warm pretty quick , but it ‚Äô s not bad and could just be me .#### #### ####[]
I unplugged them tried to turn them on - nothing .#### #### ####[]
earth magnets , heavy duty wiring ..#### #### ####[]
Meaning , if you needed to turn it off for a moment or you got disconnected from your device and it shut off on its own , you have to put them back in the case and then take them out again in order for them to turn back on .#### #### ####[]
When I get out of the car I switch over to the earbuds with no issues .#### #### ####[]
One of the earbuds is on low battery , the other at 70 % , case battery low .#### #### ####[]
I carry my phone in my pocket , so I do n't know how that could cause so much interference - never had that problem with other wireless headphones .#### #### ####[([19], [24], 'NEG')]
Only one paired and the left one didn ‚Äô t pair at all did everything I could but did not work .#### #### ####[]

I tried different size silicone suction cups , I followed the ( very limited ) instructions , and testing the fit using the Wear app was inconsistent - sometimes it would say I had a good fit in my right , but not in my left , so I would adjust the left and it would then say I did n't have a good fit in either ear , even though I had n't even touched the right one .#### #### ####[]
The second half is repetitious and not really about the power of habit .#### #### ####[]
Can ‚Äô t be a coincidence that the left side has better sound .#### #### ####[]

Sometimes it 's just one ear piece that cuts out for a few seconds , sometimes both .#### #### ####[]

As time when on they would get less and less of a charge , I believe after the second week of usage they would only charge to about 80 % .#### #### ####[]
The sound quality is pretty good .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS')]
Then when they did , the Bluetooth connection was so bad that it skipped more than my 2002 Walkman while running and the device was literally in my hands standing still .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [13], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], [10], 'NEG')]

I have two android phones that use QuickCharge 3.0 to deliver super-fast charge rates , so all my chargers are QC 3.0 equipped and I use those to charge these units .#### #### ####[]
They say it fast charges according to THEIR specs , which is still not fast charging a Samsung phone ... Also I contacted customer service to fix the issue .#### #### ####[]
My phone is 100 % charged 24/7 .#### #### ####[]
My $ 10 lipstick charger works after 7 years but this one does n't !#### #### ####[]
It was able to fully recharge my iPad and two iPhones from about 10 % to full and the power bank still had about 30 % life after that .#### #### ####[]
1st died in Jan 19 then replacement arrived on feb ... have used it about half a dozen times and within 8 weeks this one is broken and last time it worked it stunk of burning electronics .#### #### ####[]
It senses when a device ( s ) is plugged in and only charges until full then auto shuts off .#### #### ####[]
Also , I live in Chicago and take public transportation ... if my phone was to ever die and I was lost ...#### #### ####[]
Charges my iPhone and my iPad at lightning speed and has plenty of juice left .#### #### ####[]
Naturally , this case only comes up around the sides , and does n't cover the screen , but it seals the edges quite nicely .#### #### ####[]
Only used it about 10 or 12 times .#### #### ####[]
The 4 lights indicate the battery life in the power bank from what the box says and when my phone is plugged in the lights literally start turning off one by one every 5-10 minutes so my phone can literally only charge maybe up to 50 % if I ‚Äô m lucky and on top of that having to make sure it doesn ‚Äô t get to hot .#### #### ####[]
Was surprised of the size when compared to the pic on the site .#### #### ####[]
Works great-took it on vacation & honestly never had to worry about my phone 's battery .......#### #### ####[]

And best part is that they fit the beds well , and do n't slip off , or bunch up , when we use the adjustable functions of the bed ( raising or lowering head or foot of bed ) .#### #### ####[]
It traps my body heat which I love , so if you don ‚Äô t like to be warm underneath covers , I wouldn ‚Äô t recommend it .#### #### ####[]
Well , i washed these blankets as soon as i got them because after ordering i saw in the reviews theres a chance of bed bugs , i had the washer medium heat and it ruined them .- .#### #### ####[]
Said to be thick but lack of comfort and quality#### #### ####[]
We had some requirements when it came to a protector for our bed , the biggest of which is that it had to be waterproof but not that cheap noisy vinyl that they sell for kids that wet the bed , and that it had to be soft enough that it did n't affect the comfort of our new mattress .#### #### ####[]
It 's so thin that you are STILL uncomfortable on your bed/sofa mattress the material rips so easily that when you go And sit on it for the first time the corners rip a HUGE hole .#### #### ####[([14], [15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]
I think the mattress pad has fiberglass in it .#### #### ####[]
It 's almost like a light canvas .#### #### ####[]
After washing it I noticed it had water stains from the warehouse or wherever it came from .#### #### ####[]
Instead , it 's a glorified mattress pad .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [5], 'POS')]

Ours definitely is not as thick as pictured- I would say it ‚Äô s about 1/2-1 inch of fluff , no more than that- it ‚Äô s like sleeping on a comforter .#### #### ####[]
It has deep pockets for thick mattresses and it fits an adjustable mattress !#### #### ####[]
Definitely not a pet friendly product#### #### ####[]

We bought this because our new mattress is firm , too firm for me .#### #### ####[]

I put out pieces and pieces of fabric and stuffing on it out of my washer .#### #### ####[]
It his very soft though .#### #### ####[]
Been sleeping on it for a week not much fluff#### #### ####[]

We have used these for years .. We have always had a light that indicated whether or not the heater was on .. this is very difficult .. we end up turning it on & back off again to make sure it is off ...#### #### ####[]
Worked for 2 days and then it stopped working ..#### #### ####[]
Also it started to pile quite a bit .#### #### ####[]
Yes , it lacks that puffiness the pictures online show but it has been surprisingly cool .#### #### ####[]
We like the comforter to come close to or touch the floor all around the bed .#### #### ####[]

The decorative fabric donning the edge also was lifting off .#### #### ####[]
It is not as heavy as some other lamps but it is still very good .#### #### ####[]
Do n't put anything heavy or fragile on it .#### #### ####[]
So , if you want it on warm mode , when you turn it on , it is in cool mode .#### #### ####[]
In addition , and the final reason I chose this lamp over the others , is because of the non-replaceable warm LED lights ( which the other lamps did n't have ) .#### #### ####[]
If you bump it wrong it will crumble .#### #### ####[]

You essentially have to force the poles to align with the shelf which probably leads to the lack of sturdiness .#### #### ####[]

The lampshade did not come assembled , it was rolled up and you put it together with a Velcro seam down the middle .#### #### ####[]
So now even if I did manage to put it together , I would n't be able to turn it on .#### #### ####[]

Does not charge on base through case .#### #### ####[]
Purchased for my husband started falling apart after two months , should last way longer than that#### #### ####[]

( cry emoji ) I would have made this a 4 star ( okay maybe 3 star but I really like the case that much ) , but I figured out a way to ignore the funny sticker on the back that beckons the owner not to rip it up and get the metal ring out , which now gives me the case , color , sturdiness , AND charging that I wanted !#### #### ####[]
I have dropped my phone a number of times ( I am very hard on products ) and not once did the screen crack !#### #### ####[]

Very unlikely you ‚Äô ll ever get it off without either cutting it or breaking your phone .#### #### ####[]

My only complaint is that there is not a sleeve or anything so if one wanted to put it on top of a larger suitcase they could .#### #### ####[]
It 's too light weight of plastic and damages easily .#### #### ####[]

They were nice at first , but seem to be made not the best .#### #### ####[]
I ordered these in wide after reading the review and went up a size , I do not have wife feet at all and never need wide shoes .#### #### ####[]
They 're still cute but not as good quality as expected , especially for the price .#### #### ####[]
The soles of these boots broke within 3 times of wearing them .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
A little hard to get on in a hurry .#### #### ####[]
These are not great for longer walks or anything that requires a lot of steps .#### #### ####[]
They are not expensive looking , but you get what you pay for .#### #### ####[]
The product pics made the brown color look neutral and dark .#### #### ####[]
So NOT wide I wonder if they were mislabeled .#### #### ####[]
The quality wasn ‚Äô t any good#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
I wear them with everything as the dress everything up .#### #### ####[]
Clause dress and they have a lot of cushion and support that are a great help after being on your feet all day !#### #### ####[]

The only thing bad about these is the foot cushion .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [3], 'NEG')]
They are not waterproof at all , 6 uses and just dew from grass gets through .#### #### ####[]
It 's fits more like a slipper and we did n't try the where it outside because I wanted to return it it 's that sturdy enough#### #### ####[]
I have huge ankles and calf ‚Äô s .#### #### ####[]
These UGGs are so cute !#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS')]
For the last decade I 've worn them about every other day to work , to hike , or to tromp around town .#### #### ####[]
I ordered a size 11W , but unfortunately they were still a little too snug on my left foot , so I had to return .#### #### ####[]
For some odd reason will not let me add picture of the scuffed toe .#### #### ####[]
I have 2 jobs and practically live in my boots !#### #### ####[]
my feet slide forward because of the slanted part of the platform and my toes are crushed against the front of the shoe : /#### #### ####[]

Once I opened it , right away it was apparent how cheap they were .#### #### ####[]
However it ‚Äô s winter and I need to wear socks .#### #### ####[]
As someone who does n't wear heels very often , I found these to be quite comfortable .#### #### ####[]
I wear them walking the dog , to the store , work , lots of places .#### #### ####[]
Quite comfortable for a slip on boot .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [1], 'POS')]
I loved the sleekness of the boots .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [1], 'POS')]
They do keep your feet warm and are cute , however , they are not adequate for snow .#### #### ####[]
They fit true to size- I normally wear a 8-8 1/2 drowning I on the shoe , and I got a 8 1/2 and they 're perfect !#### #### ####[]
I love the look of these .#### #### ####[([3], [1], 'POS')]
They ‚Äô re good for casual and dress up vibes .#### #### ####[]
Boot runs very very small I wear a 9 but ordered a 10 and seems more like an 8 .#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3, 4], 'NEG')]

These boots were not very comfortable .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
I returned the boots , they felt like plastic .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
Also , these boots were not mistreated in any way , worn to work ( office ) , church , dates , etc .#### #### ####[]
Brought these for my daughter for Christmas and she said they feel real good on her feet#### #### ####[]
May want to use insoles as there is not a ton of support .#### #### ####[]
I had read one review alluding to the smell , and I can validate that fact !#### #### ####[]
Normal wear and already missing sections of the bottom .#### #### ####[]
These are no name plastic boots ( not `` worn vintage '' and I will be returning them AND THE WRONG SIZE LOL .#### #### ####[]
Great if I am moving , but standing to long not so good , but then again what shoe is great for standing on concrete and not moving .#### #### ####[]
Wife really loves the look and the fit .#### #### ####[([4], [2], 'POS'), ([7], [2], 'POS')]

These are even cuter in person than I expected .#### #### ####[]
Way to small in toe box .#### #### ####[]

Ordered a 11 wide , there ‚Äô s no way that shoe was an 11 wide .#### #### ####[]
Love how warm these are for winter .#### #### ####[]
That was still too tight but I made them work .#### #### ####[]
Great boots , lovely design , love the bees , insole is a bit on the slippy side but nothing major#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]
They are very comfortable while still looking great !#### #### ####[]
These are great , the only thing I 'd say is that the `` neverwet '' is a bit misleading , however in my situation I was bartending , spilled on them and did n't have time to wipe it off so after an extended period the wet soaked through .#### #### ####[]
Disappointed in how small this runs ..... looks good but narraw and shorter than my other pair of lucky brand boots#### #### ####[([7], [8], 'POS')]
Definitely do not keep your feet warm nor dry .#### #### ####[]
I have a higher arch and these boots are impossible .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [9], 'NEG')]
And it was so uncomfortable#### #### ####[]
I wore them on my damp lawn and my socks and feet were wet within seconds .#### #### ####[]
This pair is coming apart within approximately 2 months ! !#### #### ####[]
They were just a tiny bit too small , so I returned them and ordered a 8.5 .#### #### ####[]
I ordered a 10 and I can slip my foot in and out of the boot without unzipping or untying them .#### #### ####[]
My feet tend to expand and contract slightly so this may work out well .#### #### ####[]
I expected these to be extra comfortable because they are dr scholls#### #### ####[]
Feels like a cozy fluffy slipper on your feet .#### #### ####[]
Love love these didn ‚Äô t know they were soo high i did buy them a size up i wear a 9 but brought a 10#### #### ####[]
I bought these in my normal size and they are perfect .#### #### ####[]

Though a little long , the width is perfect and I just came in from working in the yard .#### #### ####[([6], [8], 'POS')]

Ran small , very stiff and uncomfortable .#### #### ####[([0], [1], 'NEG')]
I wore these boots approximately 5 times and the sole came completely away from the boot .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
The same look for a fraction of the price !#### #### ####[]
These are great and I can wear them all day at work no problem .#### #### ####[]
The seems started coming apart after a few months of wearing about once a week .#### #### ####[]
They pair great with your favorite jeans .#### #### ####[]
Could not even get foot in without struggling .#### #### ####[]
After wearing them one afternoon for about five hours , a blister formed on my right heel .#### #### ####[]
Too big , roomy around the ankle .#### #### ####[]
I love these boots , they perfectly and are very comfortable for walking in .#### #### ####[([3], [10, 11, 12, 13], 'POS')]

The first pair lasted almost a year with daily use .#### #### ####[]
I ordered a 7 wear a 6.5 and thinking room for heavy socks these seem to run bigger I could have worked with 6 or 6.5 but still keeping these#### #### ####[]
I only wore these boots 4 times , after the 3rd use I noticed how the padding on the bottom already flattened .#### #### ####[([16, 17, 18, 19], [21], 'NEG')]
But they would ‚Äô ve been cute .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , the zipper pull is way too small and the fact that the zipper is on the outside of the shoe instead of the inside made it impossible for this old lady to zip the shoe .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [7, 8], 'NEG')]
These have exceeded my expectations and kept my feet warm & dry .#### #### ####[]
Was even less comfortable than other Combat boots ...#### #### ####[]
Product was perfect from the outside but there is a rip on the inside of the tongue on the right shoe , requested a return & refund and seller immediately approved the refund and return .#### #### ####[([5], [2], 'POS')]
That helps In instances when airport metal detectors go off .#### #### ####[]
I think they run wide , but with socks and an insert they will be fine .#### #### ####[]

I ‚Äô ve replaced the charger but it is still not working .#### #### ####[]
Easy to use and my son brushes his teeth w/o me having to tell him to .#### #### ####[]
Have not had this problem with any other toothbrush so must assume this is a design flaw .#### #### ####[]
My girl understood what to do right away , it took couple days for my boy ( first he got scared , I think we just cut his hair and it reminded him vibration from machine ) but in couple days he got it as well .#### #### ####[]
Maybe it can be a hard press to get it on n off ?#### #### ####[]
The head of the brush is the size of an infant 's first tooth brush .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]

When brushing without using the app the brush will signal after 30 seconds , four times , signifying 4 quadrants of your teeth ( upper & lower ) Using the app - gives you a visualization of the four areas .#### #### ####[]

Way more expensive then a regular tooth brush to not work more than a couple months#### #### ####[]

The toothbrush shook so violently that , if the entire brush head wasn ‚Äô t in my mouth , water and toothpaste was all over the bathroom .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4], 'NEG')]

Lots of head choices which makes it convenient .#### #### ####[]
This was purchased to replace a 5 year old version when the battery seemed to not take a charge , but it turns out ( on reading the manual more carefully ) that one needs to reform the battery by completely exhausting it periodically before completely charging .#### #### ####[]
Powerful vibration and teeth feel clean .#### #### ####[]
Yes , it fell into my mouth .#### #### ####[]
Gives an excellent gentle cleaning#### #### ####[]
The brush works great and has no issue .#### #### ####[]
Very slippery when wet too .#### #### ####[]

Not convenient to use the same button for the on/off and brushing mode , but for the money , I can ‚Äô t complain .#### #### ####[]
I like the fact that they brush both up and down and have a revolving head .#### #### ####[]
However , once I started using this electric toothbrush , she would actually be the one getting ready to brush it .#### #### ####[]
Let me tell you what an improvement in her teeth .#### #### ####[]
This absolutely does not do anything but wipe my kids teeth .#### #### ####[]
However , they put the power button in exactly where ur finger wants to rest , so you find urself constantly turning it off , unless you very consciously keep ur fingers off it .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
For those that say this brush is like dentist clean , please go to the dentist , your mouth feels new after a visit , this thing gently massages your teeth to say hi to plaque but not bye to it .#### #### ####[]
It is now a single user instead of shared as we have two working models .#### #### ####[]
The only small drawback is that the travel case is quite large , but it holds an extra brush head or the charging cord can be put there .#### #### ####[]
The UV light stopped working month ago .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
I do not use this feature each time , but it is a helpful way to train yourself in proper brushing techniques .#### #### ####[]
My kid is almost 9 so it 's not like he has a tiny mouth .#### #### ####[]
It 's a manual toothbrush that vibrates .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [6], 'NEG')]
It makes my lips and half my face feel * unpleasantly * numb while I was brushing and my teeth did n't feel as clean as they did with my other electric toothbrush .#### #### ####[]
After one month of use I ca n't really judge how well the battery life will be in a year or so , I did take it on a 5 day trip and did not need to charge during that time so that 's good .#### #### ####[]
The toothbrush holds a charge well .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5], 'POS')]
I love that you can go from cleaning to whitening .. with different vibrations and frequencies .#### #### ####[]
When I attempted to use it on Friday night ; it wouldn ‚Äô t turn on .#### #### ####[]
Instead of rotating or pulsating the bristles , the entire brush head attachment vibrates 1 ) side-to-side ( which feels terribly inefficient ) and 2 ) extremely aggressively .#### #### ####[([9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [26, 27], 'NEG')]
I like the 30-second timer feature but when I turned the toothbrush on , the screech that it made every 30 seconds startled me so much I almost dropped it .#### #### ####[([11], [15], 'NEG'), ([3, 4, 5], [1], 'POS')]
Amazing charge ; hold on to your gums !#### #### ####[]
Also the smiley face when I brush long enough is great to see .#### #### ####[]
The idea is great though for whitening .#### #### ####[]
They are looking brighter and brighter every day , compared to what a manual tooth brush could do .#### #### ####[]
If you brush too hard , you are more likely to damage your teeth and wear out the brush head more quickly .#### #### ####[]
Anything beyond the minutest of pressure was actually painful .#### #### ####[]
This thing feels like a jackhammer is brushing my teeth !#### #### ####[]
My husband uses Quip from Target and this toothbrush is about 10x louder and harsher than that .#### #### ####[([8], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
So , at first I was excited about this toothbrush and it worked great .#### #### ####[]
My old one , I threw away because of the mold .#### #### ####[]
My assumptions when buying the quip : 1 ) it would be somewhere between a good manual ( no battery ) toothbrush and a Sonicare electric toothbrush in cleaning quality , and 2 ) the smaller size and weight would help on a longer trip with only carry on luggage .#### #### ####[]
The first charge lasted about six weeks .#### #### ####[]
Don ‚Äô t need to buy batteries .#### #### ####[]
It will charge with a USB A ( old box shaped one ) to USB c cable .#### #### ####[]
They tend to be a bit noisy but for the price they 're a good buy .#### #### ####[]
If you brush too light , then you are not cleaning as well as you could .#### #### ####[]
Seriously , a little wax and I could probably buff my car with this toothbrush .#### #### ####[]
Only complaint was needed a usb wall adapter ; using my iPhone one worked .#### #### ####[]
But it does n't provide the vibration or cleaning power of my previous one ... not even close .#### #### ####[]

Just as a functioning toothbrush I feel my teeth are much more thoroughly cleaned than with other electrics Ive owned without the numbing ‚Äú buzz ‚Äù feel you can get from some of those super , hypersonic brushes .#### #### ####[]
It works like a regular toothbrush but with vibrations .#### #### ####[]
Bought this for my kids , I have a Phillips sonic brush and it ‚Äô s to intense for my children so I decided to try this it ‚Äô s perfect still has a strong vibrating that makes me happy with get plaque off easy and fast and my kids now prefer the vibrating .#### #### ####[]

The AquaSonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush replaced another electric toothbrush and I noticed immediately that it was much more powerful .#### #### ####[]
It just rattles loudly with barely any strength for cleaning .#### #### ####[]
Alas changing the battery made no difference at all .#### #### ####[]
At best , the cleaning quality of the quip is equal to a manual brush , but in practice my teeth felt dirty every day .#### #### ####[]
I wish I would have looked a little longer for one that is more comfortable to hold and not so loud .#### #### ####[]
i think it works okay but not sure if it works well .#### #### ####[]
Left feeling like my teeth simply aren ‚Äô t clean .#### #### ####[]
One of the toothbrushes stopped working after 4 months and now the other after 9 months , tried to contact support but no response .#### #### ####[]
Nowhere near the cleaning ability of Sonicare .#### #### ####[]
It has a great rotation in the mouth and on the teeth .#### #### ####[]
Only three months after purchasing the toothbrush , the device holds a charge that barely gets me through one brushing cycle before it demands to be put on the charger again .#### #### ####[]
About 4 weeks after , the first brush lost a section of bristles in my mouth as I was brushing !#### #### ####[]

The toothbrush works very well and it ‚Äô s hard to live without the timer when you don ‚Äô t have this brush , but -1 star for not having a user-replaceable battery .#### #### ####[]

Two were obviously not sealed at the bottom and two others had less obvious defects .#### #### ####[]
So much less hassle than pouring from a container into a bag .#### #### ####[]

I troubleshot every aspect to make sure I was using it correctly : securing the motor firmly , correct flange sizes , optimal positioning , etc .#### #### ####[]
It saved me loads of time because I could pump and get other things done at the same time .#### #### ####[]
It 's a little noisy but sometimes I forget it 's on and not even realize until mu husband ask if I 'm pumping lol#### #### ####[]

Yes , you will still need to vacuum certain areas manually once in a blue moon and you will still need to mop once in awhile .#### #### ####[]
What it 's done in a few hours would have torn up my already aching back .#### #### ####[]
I have all wooden floors and it cleaned them beautifully while it lasted ...#### #### ####[]
It vacuums the same spots over and over .#### #### ####[]
I ordered one before it worked for a short amount of time maybe less than a month and then it stopped working .#### #### ####[]
Low pile carpet and fur , that ‚Äô s it ‚Äô s match .#### #### ####[]
Removed about 90 % of the hair and helpless with the rest .#### #### ####[]
It has been a great not having to sweep constantly .#### #### ####[]
And gets stuck super easily .#### #### ####[]
Then it would get stuck on something where all it had to do was back up .#### #### ####[]
If the robot is not in the same room as the charging station , it often gets lost and can not find it .#### #### ####[]
Conclusion : The 9+ Just isn ‚Äô t reliable enough for me to recommend .#### #### ####[]
I hate this thing but I hate vacuuming more , so I keep using it , muttering obscenities every time .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately I sent this back after it got stuck during every.single.cleaning run 5 times in a row .#### #### ####[]
Little rough runs into everything !#### #### ####[]
I was also worried about how long the bag would last and so far , it is only about 1/3 way full after a month of use .#### #### ####[]
Due to the need for daily emptying this machine was always cleaned .#### #### ####[]
I can already see that the brushes will need to be replaced in 6 months or less .#### #### ####[]
I watched it try for 20 minutes angling itself , getting lined up perfectly and then starting all over again ( ? ! ? ! )#### #### ####[]
I 'm also marking the machine down because there is absolutely no means to control the machine itself .#### #### ####[]
Pros : Just as with the 7+ , I really like how it maps the floor and how efficiently it goes about its work .#### #### ####[([13, 14, 15], [10], 'POS')]
It seemed to have a little difficulty with full coverage from edge to edge .#### #### ####[]
It is not working after 30 days .#### #### ####[]
The bagless dust bin was awesome and a $ saver .#### #### ####[]
It stops in the kitchen and goes back to the living room multiple times .#### #### ####[]
The most frequent mode of failure ( aside from the lemming impression ) is a piece of debris gets stuck in the dust cup auto-empty chute which causes a fault .#### #### ####[]
Hair does get wrapped around the bristles , but they made it very easy to pull out the brush for cleaning .#### #### ####[([6], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS')]
However , there are some caveats that I personally could n't look past .#### #### ####[]
but the real issue is that it packs short pet hair into the space behind the brush and that needs to be cleaned out fairly frequently or it will start leaving clumps of hair all over the house .#### #### ####[]
I personally at my home have a Neobot vacuum and have n't had any issues with its mapping and zone selection .#### #### ####[]

This has fallen down flights of stairs several times which has resulted in damaging our walls numerous time .#### #### ####[]
It would get `` caught '' on things like a chair leg , that was unobstructed , it just decided it was n't making a full run around it .#### #### ####[]
I believe the robot needs 12cm /4.7 inch min clearance .#### #### ####[]
Great price , great suction , long battery .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS')]
noise wise we have it on max suction and its not too bad , it can be a little noisy and you may need to turn the tv up a few clicks or go to a different room if your on the phone but its significantly quieter than a conventional vacuum cleaner .#### #### ####[]

It still pounds on the wall instead of following it ‚Äô s program .#### #### ####[]

We formerly had an 800 series , 700 series , and 600 series robots which require user to manually empty the bin .#### #### ####[]

We vacuum on a regular basis and use the Roomba for extra cleanliness .#### #### ####[]
If you don ‚Äô t have your house perfectly clean , this thing is awful to work with .#### #### ####[]
It all clumps in the opening and stays there , so you have to manually empty anyway .#### #### ####[]
It seems to work well but only has one set of brushes in the front unlike my shark vacuums .#### #### ####[]
Sadly many times it ca n't quite situate itself on the wall unit properly so continually adjusts itself with the wall unit trying the evacuate the debris unsuccessfully over and over .#### #### ####[]

I would have to actually put it in the charging station myself .#### #### ####[]
Still won ‚Äô t work , turns off with an error all the time .#### #### ####[]
So it has more Sq .#### #### ####[]
It does pick up hair .#### #### ####[]
It also doesn ‚Äô t doesn ‚Äô t have the ability to be programmed so it just goes on it ‚Äô s on path .#### #### ####[]
I think it finally died for real today a little over a year after I bought it .#### #### ####[]
When it goes off a ledge , it climbs back on surface by itself as well and does not get stuck .#### #### ####[]
It also supports self clean up .#### #### ####[]
Things I do n't like : The random pattern sometimes misses spots , especially deep corners , or under furniture too low for him to fit under .#### #### ####[]
We set up the map with rooms .#### #### ####[]
I swear I spend more time rescuing it , cleaning it out and trying to find the thing than I did just using my regular vacuum daily .#### #### ####[]
this one does n't , which is kinda lame .#### #### ####[]
If he isn ‚Äô t finished vacuuming he continues with the original floor plan .#### #### ####[]
But everything thing else works fine .#### #### ####[]

I work in a kitchen and I bought this speaker to play music while I work causing it to often get dirty ...#### #### ####[]
I took a very long time for either my iphone or my echo to even see it in pairing mode .#### #### ####[]
Have to really press it hard .#### #### ####[]
I haven ‚Äô t seen a unit this tiny sound this good before !#### #### ####[([9], [11], 'POS')]
I still kept it because even though it 's not great , I like the blue light it emits and it does n't sound terrible .#### #### ####[([15, 16], [13], 'POS')]
It 's a piece of trash ... and now , I need to buy another speaker and it has not even been a year yet .#### #### ####[]
It fits right in the palm of my hand .#### #### ####[]

Easy to install , great sound , great price .#### #### ####[]
Sony 's microphone works but not well so i 'm returning both jbl and sony .#### #### ####[]

Thought it would be great to attach to my saddle and go for trail rides/swims at the lake with my horse .#### #### ####[]
The sound quality was never great ( it always sounded a bit like you were listening through a tunnel ) , especially if you got water on it , so I guess the waterproofing was n't that great either .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4, 5], 'NEG')]
Volume is less than a $ 40 JBL and bass is far less .#### #### ####[([9], [11, 12], 'NEG'), ([0], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

2 stars because they sent me one that wouldn ‚Äô t charge which is annoying because now I have to go through an entire process of returns and whatnot now .#### #### ####[]

Got it to to find no 3 ml support .#### #### ####[]
On to sound quality ... Over all there is little to fault for a 25 speaker , but it really ca n't compete with some of the more expensive offerings in this size range .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEU')]
Common sense dictates a 3ml jack for sound equipment for compatibility .#### #### ####[]
No longer will it charge or connect to the blue tooth .#### #### ####[]
I love this speaker , it looks cute and very aesthetic .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7], 'POS'), ([3], [10], 'POS')]

Battery life is excellent , and speaker quality for the price you are paying is fantastic .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [3], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [15], 'POS')]
The sound is big for such a small package , and I use it for my Macbook Pro whose speakers are trashed .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]
The radio is great but unhappy did not come with a power cable and when called was told can either get a $ 10 credit so we can go buy a cable or ship the whole unit box back for another unit to be shipped out we had already destroyed the box so could n't do that so I guess we are going to go have to buy a power cable ourselves#### #### ####[([1], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
a TV will convert this to older Doby but without a TV with ARC you are stuck with DD+ .#### #### ####[]

Well they were for about an hour and a half and then blam without warning the right speaker blows .#### #### ####[]
This is powerful for its size !#### #### ####[]
I have n't had this product a year .#### #### ####[]
My dad has a speaker that can connect to multiple devices at a time and will just blast whichever phone is currently playing something .#### #### ####[]

I wanted something with great sound for my days at the park or just being out in my back yard and this was perfect !#### #### ####[]
Bought this thinking it would be louder than my 12 watt jvc speaker but jvc 12 watt drowns out this so called 24 wat speaker and sounds better do n't waste your money#### #### ####[]

I loved this speaker so much when I first got it ... but around a year after purchasing the base was blown out and it would not hold a charge .#### #### ####[]
The major upside is that it ‚Äô s cheap and waterproof .#### #### ####[]
