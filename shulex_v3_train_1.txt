It is well made and sturdy , but made for a tall person .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS')]
The bench is higher than a standard bench , I 'm 5 ' 9 so it keeps my lower back arched when my feet are flat on the ground lying down , which is what you want to do anyways , but it just feels weird from a official Olympic bench .#### #### ####[]
Lastly , the decline option was way to far of an angle to the point that your head is all the way to the ground .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG')]
Does the trick if very careful .#### #### ####[]
My issues come with the overall engineering/design of the product .#### #### ####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [1], 'NEG')]
It was discouraging to discover that the height of the bench at the lowest setting is higher than the advertised 15.3 '' .#### #### ####[]
Extremely wobbly on the base but when seated it stabilizes#### #### ####[([4], [1], 'NEG')]
Nice padding and the wheels with front handle are great , all benches should have this feature .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [9], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS')]
It 's wider than most benches and the gap between the back support and the seat is fairly large .#### #### ####[]
I will modify what I can and not use what I can not .#### #### ####[]
- the angle for decline is extremely hard on the back .#### #### ####[([2, 3, 4], [7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]

Easy to use , folds up nicely that I can stick it in a corner and out of the way .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [6], 'POS')]
It long enough and easy to maneuver .#### #### ####[]
It feels sturdy but I will be aware of structure issues other commenters have pointed out .#### #### ####[]

Not sure if mine were just defective or what but after 4 failed attempts to get it together I ’ ve given up .#### #### ####[]
Well , pretty much just a pile of scrap metal .#### #### ####[]
I assembled it in a short time .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS')]

The pleather on it feels cheap ; may fray/wear quickly .#### #### ####[([1], [8, 9], 'NEG'), ([1], [4, 5], 'NEG')]
Upon opening and building the bench , the legs were very wobbly and unstable , almost a return .#### #### ####[([8], [13], 'NEG'), ([8], [11], 'NEG')]
When lifting at any angle , back wobbles side to side and makes it uncomfortable to lift for fear of being thrown off balance .#### #### ####[([6], [7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG'), ([6], [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG')]

Every single peace of this was extremely cheap made to the point that when assembled , there is no way to disassemble after .#### #### ####[]
Maybe they did n't follow instructions correctly .#### #### ####[]
The bar with both sides covered in foam .#### #### ####[]
Takes up a lot of floor area .#### #### ####[]
I have had the bench for two months exactly and it has already broken and started falling apart .#### #### ####[([4], [13], 'NEG'), ([4], [16, 17], 'NEG')]

Deep indentation in fabric and cushion#### #### ####[([3], [0, 1], 'NEG'), ([5], [0, 1], 'NEG')]
Here 's the thing : it 's not * bad , * it 's just that anyone with some decent height on them will be unable to fit .#### #### ####[]
I bought it because I wanted a bench and liked that I could also do hyperextension exercise with this one .#### #### ####[]
I have literally with no waybto assemble it .#### #### ####[]
Bonus is it compact and he can keep it in his room .#### #### ####[]
Easy to move around , and the rubber feet do n't pop off like my last flat bench .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([2, 3], [0], 'POS')]
The legs attachment folds in to give it a small footprint and probably could even fit under a bed .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [9, 10], 'POS')]
While using the bench on the flat setting , I was working with dumbbells ( 40lbs ) , and it collapsed into the declined portion , causing the dumbbell to hit my head , and fractured my nose .#### #### ####[([3], [20], 'NEG'), ([3], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], 'NEG'), ([3], [35, 36, 37], 'NEG')]

Bench lifts effortlessly to avoid overcrowding my small space .#### #### ####[([0], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([0], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
It can very easily slip out if you ’ re not taking the time to make sure it ’ s locked in .#### #### ####[]
The assembly was pretty straightforward except for 2 issues - 1 ) the 2 bolts that called for a M8 * 55 bolts did not fit properly , mainly because the holes did not align properly .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], [23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG'), ([31], [32, 33, 34, 35], 'NEG')]
The center construction is conceptually nice .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4, 5], 'POS')]
I am able to use it for multiple different exercises for different muscle groups .#### #### ####[]
I know you get what you pay for but like come on , I should at least be able to screw things together .#### #### ####[]
I discovered that a part was missing after I had put the bench together .#### #### ####[([4], [6], 'NEG')]
No one answers phone either so it is a black hole of no accountability .#### #### ####[]
It might be a manufacturing error with mine , but the pin does NOT slide easily in and out , so I guess I wo n't be folding this much after all .#### #### ####[([11], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
This may also be true for those with thick legs , as there is n't a lot of clearance between the top of the bench and the bottom of the pad .#### #### ####[]
I loosened the seat and moved the support arm as far as possible to attempt to make them fit , but to no avail .#### #### ####[([18], [22, 23], 'NEG')]
I bough separate free weights and this bench is holding up great .#### #### ####[([7], [9, 10, 11], 'POS')]

Also , the bed should be longer , have trouble getting into the seat over the leg lift .#### #### ####[]

You need to provide your own adjustable wrench .#### #### ####[]
Just got mine today and it did n't come with any pins so I ca n't even use it .#### #### ####[]
Also wanted something that had a back rest that went high enough for my head when doing shoulder presses , was wide enough for back support , and allowed the seat ( not just the back ) to adjust .#### #### ####[]

I am dead average in size at 5 ' 9 '' , but the bench feels small .#### #### ####[([14], [16], 'NEG')]

For someone around my height/weight , it works very well .#### #### ####[]
First off , it was very easy to assemble .#### #### ####[]
Everyone ’ s body is unique to their selves .#### #### ####[]
I can ’ t do everything I want to do on it , and the things I can do are really uncomfortable .#### #### ####[]
Works just fine , although I 'll note that I paid a little extra to get a board that folded up .#### #### ####[]
What 's more , this bench DOES NOT facilitate a true 90 degree orthogonal configuration .#### #### ####[([5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]

The bench is sturdy , comfortable enough and folds up tall .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5], 'POS'), ([1], [8, 9, 10], 'POS')]
But they stick out far And make it so that I have to slide down the bench so that I do n't hit them while lifting .#### #### ####[]
We are left unable to do many of the exercises in the workout guide .#### #### ####[]

-Stability ( the bench itself feels stable , but your ability to stabilize your body to the ground while performing exerting lifts might be affected due to the height of the bench )#### #### ####[([3], [6], 'POS')]

Has n't had support in forever and nothing comes up .#### #### ####[]
It was all sent per instructions .#### #### ####[]

Only thing that I 'd say is it has a lot of functions and the metal and joints seems OK .#### #### ####[([17], [19], 'NEU'), ([15], [19], 'NEU')]
If you want to use this to focus on glutes , you would know that the bench needs be below your hip bones .#### #### ####[]
I 'm a smaller guy with a smaller frame ( 5 ' 6 ) so this is n't TOO much of an issue for me , but when the barbell is resting on the rack , there 's not much space in between for you to grab the bar .#### #### ####[]
Extremely dangerous to bench press or do incline lifts .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [1], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [1], 'NEG')]
Its definitely sturdy and well made .#### #### ####[]
The product was missing parts .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4], 'NEG')]
It ’ s missing part 9 NYLON LOCKING NUT ( 5 NUTS )#### #### ####[]
One major exercise you can ’ t do on this is the incline press .#### #### ####[]
So , I called the number on the manual .#### #### ####[]
Maybe that is body weight alone ?#### #### ####[]
I wanted a home weight bench that was versatile and had many options to work out with weights .#### #### ####[]
The knobs for back rest and leg need to be almost unscrewed to fold the bench which is bit annoying .#### #### ####[]
The bench is not that high , and I 'm 6 ' 2 '' and I have to lie down on it just so in order to keep my head on it .#### #### ####[]
It works but it 's overpriced for a cheaply made bench .#### #### ####[]
Good quality for a good price .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS')]
Replace missing or damaged parts '' .#### #### ####[]
No weights were in hand thankfully .#### #### ####[]
It 's great for the price but not sure how sturdy it is , especially when using heavy weights .#### #### ####[]
With it only having one steep decline angle , this makes decline nearly unusuable because you ca n't restrain your feet .#### #### ####[]
Can not go to the gym due to the COVID situation , so I decided to set up a simple home gym in my apartment .#### #### ####[]
If you lift weights regularly then this isn ’ t ideal .#### #### ####[]
You can easily find something more sturdy and stable for this price .#### #### ####[]
Had this for awhile and really struggling getting this set up .#### #### ####[]
The work out bench looks like decent quality , but I wo n't pay good money for a damaged product before I use it .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7], 'POS')]
However as far as actual function is lacking .#### #### ####[([5], [7], 'NEG')]
Not having one , I just bought replacement nuts ( 4 @ .45 each ) .#### #### ####[]
EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND LIGHT TO MOVE AROUND#### #### ####[]
Second , despite my long legs ( 34 '' inseam ) , I can not do a bench press with my feet on the floor without arching my lower back .#### #### ####[]

First time use and the left side of the seat crunched like broken particle board .#### #### ####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
This is a substitute for when I can ’ t make it to the gym .#### #### ####[]
I use it to exercise with free weights and also for doing sit-ups .#### #### ####[]
Very disappointing , since there 's no apparent regard to consumer safety .#### #### ####[]
Tools that come with package are crap , had to use my own to put it together .#### #### ####[]
It came in already partially set up , which is an amazing time saver for me .#### #### ####[]
It folds up and stores the bar when not in use#### #### ####[]
So in effect , this allows me to do regular bench decently well , seated shoulder presses/curls well , and one-arm dumbbell rows decently well .#### #### ####[([20, 21], [23, 24], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [16, 17], 'POS')]

I bought it to be able to do bench presses as well at use it to step up and down from it for legs but it is super wobbly .#### #### ####[]
You need to screw the Gnarly Knob all the way in or you ca n't trust your weight against the back rest .#### #### ####[]
I have to scoot way down the bench to be in a proper position for a press , I have to shimmy my hands towards the middle of a bar when placing it on the supports ( because the whole thing is n't wide enough and the supports sit at the same width as I place my hands ) , and the leg/ankle pads are n't adjustable so they 're uncomfortably short and sit way too high on my leg .#### #### ####[([62, 63], [64, 65, 66], 'NEG'), ([62, 63], [70, 71], 'NEG'), ([62, 63], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79], 'NEG')]

The bench racks/arms fall right under where you are supposed to place your hands on a typical olympic-sized bar .#### #### ####[]
I only bought this because I wanted a back extension .#### #### ####[]
This bench is very small and you can not do sit up as shown in video atleast for the person who had height of 6 .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
Just pull one pin out and it folds up almost flat against my garage wall .#### #### ####[]
Since I was n't interested in the adjustable settings , had I known the height was 16 '' I would have chosen a less expensive option like the DuoFit .#### #### ####[]
Comes pre assembly , just remove the pin , unfold and you 're ready to go .#### #### ####[]
I read reviews about others being too short to give support to the head .#### #### ####[]
If you 're picky , you might not like that the rods that fit into the rungs are wider than the rungs , meaning the smaller seat and larger back rests can wobble side to side quite noticeably .#### #### ####[([25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], 'NEG')]

It took my husband 2 hours to put it together and now I can ’ t use it…#### #### ####[]
Cons : It feels a little flimsy when I adjust the angle .#### #### ####[]
There was rust around one the pieces as well .#### #### ####[]
One other negative is it 's wobbly and not stable .#### #### ####[]

Sensing a disturbance in the force , I immediately ordered a replacement set .#### #### ####[]
The metal sheared off while the bench was in use .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
It surprised me but it pretty sturdy and doesn ’ t take up a lot of space .#### #### ####[]
Probably good for someone 5 ’ 6 or shorter , really challenging for me to use at 6 ’ 4 ..#### #### ####[]

I put duct tape on the part that the part was missing to level the bench .#### #### ####[]
Part of my decision to buy this bench with its length .#### #### ####[]
Been about a month since mine came no issues works very well .#### #### ####[]
I 've been wanting one for a long time but did n't want to pay an arm and a leg .#### #### ####[]

The preacher curl rest is supposed to be height adjustable and also serve as a pad for back extensions .#### #### ####[]
That means - some will be perfect and work well and some are just duds .#### #### ####[]

the previous benches would move around too easily due to lack of friction / being too lightweight .#### #### ####[]
Seems sturdy so far and was easy to assemble .#### #### ####[]
However , you need to manually turn a knot every time you want to adjust the inclination of the back rest .#### #### ####[]
Like every one else says the mans private part section needs a slot in the mounting cushion , not a big deal though .#### #### ####[]
I have tried every combination possible .#### #### ####[]
You need to lay a folded up large towel or throw on it for a little cushioning , or maybe cut an old soft exercise mat to size .#### #### ####[]

Trying to get it truly squared with the rack can be frustrating .#### #### ####[]
It does not attach to the frame , as the hex bolt is either too short or the frame is bent .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [14, 15], 'NEG'), ([18], [20], 'NEG')]

I was looking to add a bench for my small home gym , I looked at higher end bench only to discover Flybird , the thing that got me first was its design and since it is foldable I could store it without much hassle .#### #### ####[([32], [37], 'POS'), ([32], [40, 41, 42, 43, 44], 'POS')]
When fully flat , it is a big gap which is very uncomfortable depending on how tall you are .#### #### ####[([8], [12], 'NEG'), ([8], [7], 'NEG')]
I extended it to its longest feature and it still feels short , and I ’ m only 5 ’ 8 ” .#### #### ####[]
It also came well packaged as evidence from the pics and does n't take up a ton of space .#### #### ####[]
The vertical bars that hold the barbell are perfectly positioned where my hands go to lift the bar .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS')]
It 's lightweight enough to move out of the way easily in my small workout space , but seems very sturdy .#### #### ####[]
I am 5'10 185lbs and the seat of the bench is to narrow for me to seat on .#### #### ####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [11, 12], 'NEG')]
It is secured in there so I do n't have any concerns about the handle somehow flying off , but it is noticeably loose , especially compared to the other handle which is like a rock .#### #### ####[]
I am a little concern that I could work the pins loose during a workout and the bench could collapse under me .#### #### ####[]
I had to use a small piece of cardboard to even it out on one of the legs , not even noticeable .#### #### ####[]
The hinges are huge and strong , and it seems like it could support a good amount of weight ( I included some pictures ) .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5], 'POS')]
It 's very light for an incline bench , so that 's a plus for moving around , but does not feel very stable .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], [3], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS')]

Versatile and easy to assemble and a fair price as well .#### #### ####[]
However , the adjustable backrest feels wobbly when in use .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [6], 'NEG')]
It took just over an hour .#### #### ####[]
I noticed this when I finish installation .#### #### ####[]
A bit unsteady on my carpet and a bit too wide#### #### ####[]
The fact that it is heavy duty also means that it is pretty heavy .#### #### ####[]

Perfect for a heavier guy .#### #### ####[]
For the price it is not too bad , fairly sturdy , and usable .#### #### ####[]
Could be an issue for some people#### #### ####[]
I had to manually widen the holes with a tapered reamer .#### #### ####[]
It will rock a lot side to side , not very sturdy#### #### ####[]
A couple parts were welded off center .#### #### ####[([2], [4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
I was bench pressing and accidentally missed putting the bar back and it almost hit me in the face but the safety arms caught it .#### #### ####[]
Changing the bench is easy to do .#### #### ####[]
The metal rings on the bolts are supposed to be all bent , so you get a tighter seal , I presume .#### #### ####[]
But worst is the material which is like a canvas and very `` grippy '' .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [1], 'NEG')]

So far , this bench has held up to 6 weeks of 4-day per week heavy lifting for my upper body and the bench has never felt as if I could not support whatever I threw at it .#### #### ####[]

If you looking for convenient storage and low cost , then this is it .#### #### ####[]
Standing on the base will solve that issue , but it 's not always comfortable or desired .#### #### ####[]

The tricky part is to understand how it changes position I just found it !#### #### ####[]
Easy to assemble and comfortable#### #### ####[]
Oh , I am 5 ' 4 '' and it fits my frame .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m on the heavy side 235lbs and it ’ s super sturdy doesn ’ t make any noise solid all around .#### #### ####[]

Not sturdy but still a good deal .#### #### ####[]
Some reviews complained about too narrow of a back , I would disagree .#### #### ####[]
But I definitely emphasize LIGHT dips , as the handle bar pieces flex a lot more than I personally am comfortable with ( other reviews report the welding failed on this part ) , and I could do just as well without them .#### #### ####[([9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 'NEG')]
The little tools they give you to put it together were worthless .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [11], 'NEG')]

Not too high so easy to access dumb bells on floor .#### #### ####[]

So as you lift , the weights will clang against the mid-section that holds the 2 pieces together .#### #### ####[([6], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]
Feels like a real gym .#### #### ####[]
We 'll the only way you can not tell if it 's locked in place us if you never finished elementary school .#### #### ####[]
So the actual bench is very easy to assemble and solid as a rock , it also includes a cheap assembly tool , but I would really advise using a ratchet , the bolts are al standard metric , thought they did cheap out and make one a phillips head to avoid having to ship a second assembly tool .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([3], [10], 'POS')]
Another problem is it needs a foot rest or a cross bar to help you move into position for the hyperextension movement .#### #### ####[]
Quality of elements is not so bad , but if you consider to workout at home , consider something better#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 'NEU')]

The only complaint that I have about the assembly instructions was putting the cushions on .#### #### ####[]
- Not as compact ( for storage ) as I thought .#### #### ####[]
At that time , it was worth $ 150 because you literally could not find a bench from any of the higher quality fitness product manufacturers .#### #### ####[]

Super easy to put together , though the instructions will have you thinking you are assembling more than you actually do .#### #### ####[]
Makes it difficult to operate when you go to higher weights .#### #### ####[]

Bought this for traveling so tonight nothing gets charged .#### #### ####[]
Goes with the cords I ordered both nice and like that I have extra#### #### ####[]
It is easy to setup and simple to use .#### #### ####[]
I am guessing that the phone receiving cool air directly from the air vent behind the mount helps keep components cool and increase charging efficiency ( if you ’ ve ever used a wireless charger you know a byproduct of the process is a decent amount of heat ).#### #### ####[]
I own 3 other wireless chargers .#### #### ####[]
I did buy an Amazon basics USB - C cord that was longer for the bedside since I needed more length to reach from the outlet , but the other chargers have the original cord and I ' m able to top off the charge on the phone about 10 - 20 % in approximately 10 mins before heading out the door .#### #### ####[]

Doesn ’ t overheat and with the two different ports built into one brick uses minimal space .#### #### ####[]

This charger did nothing for my specific samsung tablet .#### #### ####[]
These did not work for the 2 devices we wanted to use with .#### #### ####[]

Charger fits loose in the 12v lighter socket - too small in diameter#### #### ####[([12], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([0], [2], 'NEG')]
Doesn ' t work on most phones#### #### ####[]
It was not sufficient for my iPad Pro .#### #### ####[]
Only get an upgrade to 5 stars if it lasts longer than 2 years .#### #### ####[]
In my experience , all wireless charging is much slower than wired charging .#### #### ####[]
This would be really great if it would keep charging .#### #### ####[]
I can say that I had to change my case from the otter box defender to a MagSafe otter box .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m usually a huge fan of anker products , but pretty disappointed this time around .#### #### ####[]
don ’ t charge fast at all .#### #### ####[]
How slow one might ask ?#### #### ####[]
Works great and it 's fast#### #### ####[]
Vertical charging doesn ’ t work with the case on just gets a blinking orange light on the stand .#### #### ####[]
When it was working , it only held close to the charge that the phone already had before using it .#### #### ####[]
Another one did n't work right out of the package , and another got so hot it nearly set my bed on fire ( and no , it was n't under a pillow or blanket .#### #### ####[]
Cool looking but doesn ’ t charge the phone very fast works with my case though#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([14], [11], 'POS')]
Great concept & design , just doesn ' t work#### #### ####[]
The light on the bottom is a bit bright and could actually be used as a night light for some .#### #### ####[]
The S22 Initially says " Fast charging " however only for a couple seconds .#### #### ####[]
You need both hands to unplug the phone from this charger .#### #### ####[]
It basically held the charge and didn ’ t boost it .#### #### ####[([4], [6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
Would give it 0 stars if I could .#### #### ####[]

Takes away the convenience of wireless charging#### #### ####[]
( Can ’ t show my phone cause I have to use it to take pictures lol )#### #### ####[]
It takes several hours for my watch to charge whereas on an Apple charger i can recharge in around an hour .#### #### ####[]
So much better than stock phone charger .#### #### ####[]
My phone charges at a similar rate as if i used a regular charger .#### #### ####[]
I use mine daily and so far , have had no problems , no over - heating and no failure .#### #### ####[]
It worked for one day then stopped charging my iPhone 12 .#### #### ####[]
The charging cord it comes with is not a lightning , but I can plug the cord I already have in and it converts to a fast charging pad .#### #### ####[]
I tried to find it for about an hour , and finally realized it was the power adapter for this unit , which was plugged into the wall .#### #### ####[]
The product looks really cheap , not as picture showed .#### #### ####[]
In a day the metal part bent on the charger .#### #### ####[([9], [4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
I think they sent me an older model trying to pass it off as a new one .#### #### ####[]
I emailed and asked for a refund / return .#### #### ####[]
Does not charge at all even after keeping it for more than 2 hours .#### #### ####[]

Didn ’ t charge phone at all#### #### ####[]
I like that this does as exactly as the seller states .#### #### ####[]

It stopped charging for no apparent reason last night Up to that point , pretty much did what was expected .#### #### ####[]
So , it ' s sits in my electronics drawer .#### #### ####[]
Does not work with my Samsung#### #### ####[]
Also , sometimes when I put the phone on it randomly stop charging at times .#### #### ####[]
Loved them so much bought another set of them#### #### ####[]

Save yourself some money and buy from a different manufacturer .#### #### ####[]
the charging cord has a standard USB male plug to connect to a charging cube .#### #### ####[]
I really wanted this one to work for me but it doesn ’ t feel safe for my phone to constantly be hard reset while I ’ m in the middle of using it .#### #### ####[]
AirPods with be charging all night and only charge 25 % placed in the correct manner so the charging light lights up .#### #### ####[]

this do charge my Iphone , however it takes just as long as any charger .#### #### ####[]
I want to be able to plus this into my laptop to charge both phones but a laptop won ’ t power both ( or at least mine won ’ t ) so I ’ m still charging one at a time#### #### ####[]
If you need a fancy watch charger and phone holder .#### #### ####[]
It ' s nice to know I won ' t accidentally push it off the edge .#### #### ####[]
Also the angling of the tip is not aligned to naturally insert into the port so I have to double check each time --- it is angled in reverse .#### #### ####[([2], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
When I first bought the charger .#### #### ####[]
My ONLY gripe with this device so far is that the wire running from the car charging power adapter to the charging unit connects directly to the unit .#### #### ####[]
This product stopped working in less than a month of use .#### #### ####[]
Happy to update rating if they decide to send a low - profile cable that sits below the plane of the charger surface .#### #### ####[]
Base over heats and stop working .#### #### ####[]
Been using this for a few weeks now and its worth the price .#### #### ####[]
You ’ d figure a company known for its high quality products would have a better QA before packaging it .#### #### ####[]
I have never had a problem charging these devices to 100 % overnight , and even the charging light is barely noticeable , compared to the extremely bright light on my previous charger .#### #### ####[([17, 18], [20, 21], 'NEG')]
It is not recommended to charge 3 high - powered devices ( phones / tablets ) simultaneously as doing so could trigger the device ' s overload protection ."#### #### ####[]
I am sad this happened cause now I gottah go buy another one for 18 $ Smh 😒#### #### ####[]
Very convenient for nightstand .#### #### ####[]
only thing I dont like is its not exactly the MagSafe size .#### #### ####[]
Worked twice then quit charging .. returning ..#### #### ####[]
At first this worked fine , but the warranty is only 2 years .#### #### ####[]
Very nice idea / product .#### #### ####[]
Garbage - doesn ’ t hold the phone and the connection is week#### #### ####[([10], [12], 'NEG')]
Also being able to charge my iPhone and IPad at the same time is also a plus .#### #### ####[]
But it appeared to be a knockoff as well , and would n't charge my phone with its Otterbox commuter case on it .#### #### ####[]
Had this for a few months and it just stopped working .#### #### ####[]
The worst thing about it is that it charges very slow .#### #### ####[]
Unable to charge with phone case on .#### #### ####[]
This is confirmed by my hundreds of miles of driving with my phone on this mount .#### #### ####[]
The only reason I ’ m taking a star is because during charging you can ’ t see the voltage .#### #### ####[]
I like that it has the 2 USB ports but one of the plugs is a bit loose when plugged in and has a tendency to look plugged in when it ’ s not or slip out .#### #### ####[([10, 11, 12, 13], [15, 16, 17], 'NEG'), ([6, 7, 8], [1], 'POS')]

I would place my watch on the charger and it would take forever to charge .#### #### ####[]
Took stars off because they sent a cord with it that sits proud of the charger surface , meaning that the " thin - ness " of the charge pad is lost a bit because the phone can ' t sit flat on it unless it ' s sideways .#### #### ####[]
And they charge faster than this .#### #### ####[]
But don ' t make the mistake I did of thinking the male connector is a mini usb ( standard on many devices ).#### #### ####[]
I only have very minor complaints .#### #### ####[]
Usually I only plug my phone in when using GPS anyways so as long as it is giving some power than we are good .#### #### ####[]
It doesn ’ t work well with phones with covers so to ensure it charges you need to take the case off .#### #### ####[]
I have to take my phone out of its protective case because of the wide head of the charger .#### #### ####[([18], [14, 15], 'NEG')]

The only issues I have are that it does make your phone a bit warm on the back and it also emits electrical interference .#### #### ####[]
My one issue and it ' s my own fault for not checking into it is that the charger does not shut off when your phone is fully charged !#### #### ####[]
At 89 % this charger was 31 minutes where my USB wired charger was 21 minutes .#### #### ####[]

This product isn ’ t great , cheaply made , wouldn ’ t charge my iPhone 12 with the case on it , the cord for the headphones to charge is just run through a rubber grommet and it is just cheesy .#### #### ####[]
Update - customer service reached out to me and made everything wonderful !#### #### ####[]
I was a bit disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Very slim .#### #### ####[]
No water was actually present , because our phones had not been near water and different charger cords did not cause the same message .#### #### ####[]
What a waste of money !#### #### ####[]
Works great so far , and unlike other products , diameter is close enough to OEM that it fits into 3rd party stands#### #### ####[]

wont charge the phone at all .#### #### ####[]

Perfect for charging iPhone , Apple Watch & earbuds all in one convenient location .#### #### ####[]

Shows charging but the battery percentage doesn ’ t move .#### #### ####[]
It ' s not the company that makes these fault but it ticks me off the Apple keeps changing this stuff , so we have to buy new , plus the cord or plug are even in with new 13 phones .#### #### ####[]
If you have a pre - curved or bulky watch band that may cause issues .#### #### ####[]
The most it charges my Pixel 6 Pro is at 18 watts and thats with adaptive battery off .#### #### ####[]

It starts to charge , then just stops charging .#### #### ####[]
I ' m asking for a refund .#### #### ####[]
The phone stayed on and didn ’ t rotate or do anything crazy all throughout my journey .#### #### ####[]
Even took it on vacation , no worries about having 3 different chargers .#### #### ####[]
Got it in January .. stopped working in May .#### #### ####[]
There is no fuzzy wires running around .#### #### ####[]
It works fine for both .#### #### ####[]
Get one that is more powerful and has more flexibility for the size of the case .#### #### ####[]

The watch charging station will let go of the watch if you accidentally hit it unless you wrap it .#### #### ####[]
Neither of the boxes or cables sent work anymore to charge the phone and the return window just closed so that ’ s cool lol#### #### ####[]
Sometimes it dirks most of the time it dies not .#### #### ####[]

After a few days ( and a couple hundred miles due to some longer trips recently ) I can share my experience using this mount / charger for hours at a time and minutes at a time .#### #### ####[]
Since I now have a phone and tablet with usb - c I wanted to take advantage of the quick charge feature .#### #### ####[]
It seems to work well with my iPhone 12 , but doesn ’ t work well with the Apple Watch .#### #### ####[]
Probably I got a lemon but this charger was charging super slow , like 1 % every 3-4 minutes .#### #### ####[([7], [9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
I have tried every way possible to put my phone on it for it to work .#### #### ####[]
Im unable to see a speed of charge difference but its nice to get both home & car chargers for a low price .#### #### ####[]
Didn ' t fit an fire stick#### #### ####[]
Within two months one of them stopped charging .#### #### ####[]
Only 1 out of the 4 actually charges our phones .#### #### ####[]
Gave this to a family member as a gift It was wrapped very well no damages only problem is as soon as she tried it didn ’ t work at all#### #### ####[]
Bought it , worked for 2 weeks and broke .#### #### ####[]
It is fast charging compared to my previous car charger and my child and I can charge our phones at the same time !#### #### ####[]

Quality is pretty decent , though some better strain relief on the ends of the charging cable would have been nice .#### #### ####[([0], [3], 'POS')]
Didn ' t work with my phone , but my brother in - law loved it .#### #### ####[]

After we received this charger I realized it was a game changer .#### #### ####[]
Stopped working before the month was out .#### #### ####[]
Buyer beware , if you genuinely need 5v @ > 1A then these are not for you .#### #### ####[]
It charges fast , and last for about a day or two depending on your usage .#### #### ####[]
Honestly , love the design and lights which you can turn on and off .#### #### ####[([6], [2], 'POS'), ([4], [2], 'POS')]
I left it plugged in for at least 5-6 hours and my iPad only charged 2 % .#### #### ####[]
Couldn ' t return because tossed out the wrapping .#### #### ####[]
Never dropped it , never bumped it , no kids in the home , looks perfect like new , and every time it just stops working .#### #### ####[]
I bought this product because I trusted the brand but now I have doubts .#### #### ####[]
I would not recommend as I would be very concerned of it causing a fire .#### #### ####[]
I have the newest iPhone and I got it in July and now my battery is fried due to the generic charger .#### #### ####[([14], [16], 'NEG')]
I would still buy it again , I just try to keep something in the sockets so it ' s not as bright .#### #### ####[]

I used a different USB power supply and its charging again .#### #### ####[]

This is false advertising I am very disappointed in this company , and product .#### #### ####[]
super inconsistent on whether your phone picks up charge and the light on it can randomly turn strobe like#### #### ####[([11], [15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]
The cord with the charger is also thick and short at only 3 feet long , allowing for a faster charge .#### #### ####[([4], [7], 'POS')]
I really liked these - I had two - for the first couple of months .#### #### ####[]
It charges 1 Samsung Galaxy Note 4 used as the WiFi tether , 1 amazon echo dot hooked up via wifi , and 1 iPhone SE , all charging relatively fast .#### #### ####[]
But it works well for what it is .#### #### ####[]
After three months of purchasing , the charging station began making these weird popping sounds whenever I had it powered .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
I ’ m still using it now from my iPhone X to now my 12 Pro .#### #### ####[]
This charger is a great buy for the price .#### #### ####[]
No searching for the “ right ” placement to get it to charge .#### #### ####[]
So while they ’ re cheap , they ’ re not trustworthy .#### #### ####[]
First let me say , I love that I don ’ t need to plug my phone in , I can just lay it on this disk and it will charge .#### #### ####[]
It was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent and I didn ’ t have time to send it back before the return window so I just wasted $ 30 .#### #### ####[]
I was super excited to get this in and when I plugged it in it wouldn ' t work .#### #### ####[]
Works with iPhone , iPad , Highly recommend this for gadget lovers !#### #### ####[]
Needs a stronger magnet for the phone .#### #### ####[]
I have been using this for a while now .#### #### ####[]
It does , but not at the advertised 23 watts ( Amps x Volts ).#### #### ####[]
Then the clear plastic dividers started snapping and now none are intact to hold up any device .#### #### ####[([2, 3, 4], [5, 6], 'NEG')]

No other charging mat has this same problem .#### #### ####[]

After using them for a few days I did notice the box making a noise like many other reviewers had stated .#### #### ####[([11], [12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
The first one did not work but the company sent me a replacement with no issues or returning the broken one and so far it seems to be charging my s20 ultra at superfast speed .#### #### ####[([28, 29, 30, 31], [33, 34], 'POS')]
However , just a few weeks in I noticed what I thought was the sound of a cricket under my bed .#### #### ####[]
And slowly it sure did , took 30 minutes to charge only 3 % !#### #### ####[]
Ordered a box of three as of today only one charger still works#### #### ####[]
But if they were doing that , why not just do a normal size MagSafe charger on the bottom ?#### #### ####[]
Never dropped or mishandled it .#### #### ####[]
Pretty disappointed but I suppose you get what quality you pay for#### #### ####[]
Only one complaint : the USB jacks are just way too tight .#### #### ####[]
This does not work if you have a case on your phone .#### #### ####[]
They at first work great , then after about a month or two something stops working .#### #### ####[]
Absolute crap , stopped working within a month .#### #### ####[]
I tried different cable etc ... Its now a paperweight .#### #### ####[]
Was working fine with some flaws as mentioned in other reviews but I purchased this on April 21st and as of May 15th it has completely stopped charging at all .#### #### ####[]
Not impressed with the vent clamp , even when you tighten the clamp as much as you can it comes loose after a short time , the clamp seems to be at an angle so it ’ s only the front of the clamp that makes contact#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG')]

I keep it next to my bed and charge my phone on it at night .#### #### ####[]
The day I received the item , I noticed slow charging speed compared to the one I already had .#### #### ####[]
So overall I ’ d give it a 5 for home use and 2 for car use .#### #### ####[]
This was a used charger !#### #### ####[]
It does not stay magnified for long .#### #### ####[]
Doesn ’ t stay in the vent at all , falls off so easily and the magnet is pretty strong until the vent falls over from the weight and the phone is under your feet while you are driving .#### #### ####[([16], [18, 19], 'POS')]
I had it plugged into a pc and was streaming video while charging when my iphone shut down due to overheating .#### #### ####[]
Works just like the rest I have had and love that the cord has a Velcro wrap tie as my other one didn ' t and got stolen of of my vehicle after I forgot to lock it when I traveled to a different state .#### #### ####[]

The Anker will somehow trigger a " power cable connected " chime moments after shutdown which will cause the Mac to turn on by itself again .#### #### ####[]
This product charges Apple Watch extremely slowly ( unlike the enclosed charger which does an excellent job ), will not charge the Apple 12 Pro Max consistently and often randomly stops charging it , but does charge the Apple AirPods .#### #### ####[]

No funciona con ningún smartwatch .#### #### ####[]
The watch always charges , but the phone position does not !#### #### ####[]
The cord length is sufficient for me if I were to use the USB - C , but it is not detachable which would be a plus since I can ' t use it .#### #### ####[]
They reached out after my review to see how they could make things right .#### #### ####[]

If your vent is vertical then it just wants to fall down because of the weight .#### #### ####[]
You get 6 months tops and it does not connect anymore .#### #### ####[]
This car charger is the best for my SUV .#### #### ####[]
Maybe not an issue with this design , this 3 instead if 1 star , but be aware the phone will charge very very slowly .#### #### ####[]
It does not fast charge , sometimes they do n't seem to charge at all#### #### ####[]
Plus , it includes the power supply , so you don ' t need any of your own cables .#### #### ####[]
I love the fact that I can charge both items on this disk , but I ’ m sure other brands can do the same and charge faster and more effectively .#### #### ####[]
so if you buy this just keep in mind the charging box may not work .#### #### ####[]
I loved the 3 - in - 1 charging and esthetics .#### #### ####[]
I bring those specific ones up because 1 ) their charging speed is faster , and 2 ) they have about the same magnetic benefits as this one .#### #### ####[]
Bought it may 3 and today june 18th it stopped working .... i thought it was my phone problem .. but i had old charger which was not fast charger i plugged in that and it was charging ..#### #### ####[]
I threw it in the trash .#### #### ####[]
It ' s a shame too because these are expensive , but otherwise , work great .#### #### ####[]
Which is why some weight and a good , flat bottom are important and are a plus .#### #### ####[]

I just used it for a month 😔 I am really upset of the product .#### #### ####[]
Just randomly stop charging .#### #### ####[]
I have zero complaints otherwise .#### #### ####[]
Watch charging does not work .#### #### ####[]
Was a real hassle to wake and grab the phone only to see it ’ s still empty because it stopped charging .#### #### ####[]
The unit functioned as advertised and did charge multiple devices simultaneously .#### #### ####[]
Really slow charging#### #### ####[]
The power box was still working but the cord just stop .#### #### ####[]
It also stops charging when the battery is full , which makes it great for overnight charging .#### #### ####[]
So the phone battery drains , even as the phone heats to the point where iOS reports that it cannot operate until the phone is cooled down .#### #### ####[]
Took the case off which IS an ok use according to ESR , and the magnet is still terrible , there ’ s no “ lock ” with the magsafe and without a case it ’ s all too slippery anyway .#### #### ####[([29], [39], 'NEG'), ([15], [18], 'NEG')]
Good product ....... would like to have a longer cord .......#### #### ####[]
Tried to return it but somehow this thing only has a 30 day return policy ?#### #### ####[]
Some nights I put my phone on it and it will charge .#### #### ####[]
This is a genius product and saved us from many fights on who gets to use the charger on long trips .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , when I can get this charger to work , it will just hold the phone at its current battery life , rather than actually charging it .#### #### ####[]
Long cord especially nice .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [3], 'POS')]

Doesn ’ t charge phone with case#### #### ####[]
It does suck removing the case every time , but if you want to prolong your lithium ion battery life , they always recommend taking the phone out of the case to diminish the heat build up during charging which decreases overall battery life .#### #### ####[]
Customer service was spectacular and prompt !#### #### ####[]
I got them just now they look super low quality , plugged it in it won ’ t charge then I had to push it then I had it connected , I had to write this review so people who pay 20 + dollars and wait 2 to 3 days to get it they can pay 10 more doller and get one from apple and keep it for years .#### #### ####[]
Plus it doesn ' t charge well with my phone case .#### #### ####[]
I sat my 50 % charged phone in the cradle and on the phones screen it said it would be an hour and fifty - five minutes to reach a full charge .#### #### ####[]
Purchased to use in conjunction with Samsung S21 + phone .#### #### ####[]
It should just be staying inside your car … doesn ’ t really need to be built like a tank if you ask me .#### #### ####[]
Do be aware if you plug a single USB - C 100w port to a MBP 16 - inch , it will not stay shutdown .#### #### ####[]

Bought this item early May .#### #### ####[]
I liked that this one was definitely low profile but what would make it even better is if I could twist it so that the USB plugged into the bottom no matter how my outlet was oriented .#### #### ####[]
If the phone is at a low percentage ( < 20 % ) an 8 hour charge will not bring it to 100 % .#### #### ####[]
We didn ' t get maybe a good working batch of these cords so I would not recommend them .#### #### ####[]

Originally : Works ok for my home but my car doesn ’ t recognize this cord so I can ’ t enjoy Apple CarPlay and no music or navigator me while on the road :( Overall the cord is sturdy and basic nothing to write home about , but in a month that I ’ ve had it it didn ’ t bend which can happen with some cords .#### #### ####[([37], [39], 'POS')]

Great product for its multiple USB ports but it ' s so heavy even without all the cables filled that it falls out of the socket if it ' s not sturdy enough to hold it .#### #### ####[]
When I purchased it there were no reviews and I figured “ let ’ s give it a shot ”.#### #### ####[]
They ’ re nice and compact and the best thing is that the ports are angled up / down so you won ’ t have cables sticking out the charger any more .#### #### ####[]

My problem is the charging capabilities ... not sure if I got a defective one ( I ’ m replacing the one I have ) but it takes FOREVER to charge and even then it never charges my iPhone 11 or my tozo wireless earbuds to 💯% ... some could argue ur iPhone or earbuds are old but they were both purchased this month .#### #### ####[]

Learning lesson ..... test all ports upon receiving the product .... discovered it when I needed it .#### #### ####[]
No visible defects in product however the construction and size of the tip of the plug is slightly larger than Samsung and other similar OEM standard micro USB inputs .#### #### ####[]
The only outlet it fits securely in my experience is a gfci outlet .#### #### ####[]
The magnet for the watch is not strong enough , so an Apple Watch slides down out of charging range ( I have the watch band that comes with the watch , not some heavy replacement ); my iPhone has to be carefully placed 3 - 4 times before it gets in the perfect position to charge ( I have a thin , apple neoprene case , nothing bulky ); the AirPods charging spot it the best of the three and only works ~ 50 % of the time .#### #### ####[]
Secondly while the phone charges , I have to position it correctly over the magnets .#### #### ####[]

The point of all of this pretext information to my review is people either need to act a little bit more intelligent or actually find a way to become more intelligent because these complaints are things should know ahead of time and understand there are easy solutions for such complaints .#### #### ####[]
It charges my wireless earbud case and my Samsung phone with no issues .#### #### ####[]

The watch charger faces the rear of the stand , so if you ’ re like me and keep it on a night stand under a lamp .#### #### ####[]
Works perfect and at a far better value than purchasing from my local cell provider !#### #### ####[]
Was disappointed to find that none of the 4 of them were capable in spite of being advertised as such .#### #### ####[]
I have used the phone in the same case with 4 cards in it on other wireless chargers with no problem .#### #### ####[]
The other 3 ports have been working for over 2 weeks in a car that is hot and humid all the time .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
Unfortunately , with that cover on the back of my phone the wireless charger won ' t work .#### #### ####[]

Looks great but was disappointed when I tried to charge my iPhone 12 w / case still on .#### #### ####[]

I put my phone on it at night and wake up to full .#### #### ####[]
If you have lost your OEM charger or if it has died on you , this is probably a fine replacement .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s small , thin and unobtrusive .#### #### ####[]
Got it primarily to charge Apple Watch easier but the angle the Apple Watch portion is on doesn ’ t let the watch sit on it .#### #### ####[]
BUT does NOT fit my note 4 by Samsung#### #### ####[]
I am still bothered that the newer iPhones do not come with a charging plug .#### #### ####[]
It never charges the watch and buds do just fine#### #### ####[]
The watch post is very flimsy and was already snapped off before I ever got to touch it .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([0, 1, 2], [5], 'NEG')]

Only a restart of the phone stopped it .#### #### ####[]
The magnet is strong enough that you can ’ t just set your phone on this and pick it back up like a qi charging pad .#### #### ####[]
There isn ’ t anything to hold the phone charging spot up .#### #### ####[]
Plus it was very difficult to put the cord in for the Apple Watch .#### #### ####[]
We charge a number of items on our kitchen island , that has outlets on either side .#### #### ####[]
Though once aligned , the phone charging does not seem to be a problem .#### #### ####[]
Worked great with my iPhone 11 Pro Max .#### #### ####[]
It seems to be solid enough to survive me accidentally stepping on it which could happen if it sits on the floor .#### #### ####[]
It has one plug and all his gadgets are organized and can charge at the same time .#### #### ####[]
Doesn ' t fast charge my Samsung#### #### ####[([4], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'NEG')]

I was looking for a low profile charging block for over my kitchen desk .#### #### ####[]
First and still best magsafe charger I ' ve used .#### #### ####[]
That ' s why I bought it for myself and when my kids are in my truck .#### #### ####[]
Doesnt work with Galaxy watch#### #### ####[]
Very compact and easily stored for travel .#### #### ####[]
Not that it ' s that big a deal but something i think would ' ve been a nice addition .#### #### ####[]
Funy it ' s called fast charger ... lol#### #### ####[]
I also don ’ t like that it isn ’ t magnetized ….#### #### ####[]
It came here just 2 days , uses easily .#### #### ####[]
Worked for a month then started having power issues , eventually would cause the phone and the watch to drain rather than charge .#### #### ####[]
JUST after the warranty period it dies typical of this crap .#### #### ####[]
Emailed Share Sunshine customer service ( thank you Amy !)#### #### ####[]
Overall this is a convenient device and I 'm happy with the purchase .#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'POS')]
I had it for 2 months and the charging block stopped working .#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9], [10, 11], 'NEG')]

It will not charge all 3 simultaneously .#### #### ####[]
5W , charging speeds were adequate .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [5], 'POS')]
Used it sporadically so it wasn ' t overuse .#### #### ####[]
I was super about excited about getting this product and loved it for the first three months and then I noticed during the day I would hear that sound like when you have a bad cord… The chime of the sound of it to start charging then again and again .#### #### ####[([44, 45], [37, 38, 39, 40], 'NEG')]
Stopped charging my phone after a month of purchase#### #### ####[]
Overall though for the price pretty satisfied .#### #### ####[]
did not work on my Pixel phone#### #### ####[]
Only works on certain phones but on the ones it does work on — it works great !#### #### ####[]
I can ’ t add photo or video because the phone has to be on charger to show it dosent work with or with out magnetic case .#### #### ####[]
Great charger , worth the money .#### #### ####[]
I ' d pass on this one .#### #### ####[]
Charging block will not work with the charger .#### #### ####[]
The charging ports are small and takes to long full charge#### #### ####[]
Instead of having three different cables and a wireless charging pad .#### #### ####[]
For my Apple Watch is great , but the phone charger won ’ t work .#### #### ####[]
I want seller to contact me .#### #### ####[]
I use this product every time I get in the car so I ’ ll be sure to update if anything notable changes regarding my opinion / experience with it :)#### #### ####[]
When I wake up it ' s less than the night before .#### #### ####[]
My only complaint is the charging speed , which isn ' t necessarily their fault .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [2], 'NEG')]
It doesn ’ t charge or light up anymore .#### #### ####[]
You get what you pay for .#### #### ####[]
If you want to plug it into the wall you ' ll need to acquire an adapter .#### #### ####[]
this is very sleek and nice looking feels and looks high quality#### #### ####[]
I have a Note 10 + ... My sister a LG5 ... we both get charges faster from using cords on BOTH PHONES !#### #### ####[]
Secondly , if your phone has ANY KIND of case , it won ’ t work .#### #### ####[]
Didn ' t try so can ' t review the product !#### #### ####[]
Not what I was looking for .#### #### ####[]
I am wondering if it will cause damages to the hearbuds and phone as well .#### #### ####[]
Worth your money , but is not fast charging for any of the phones I tried .#### #### ####[]
I don ' t know how to leave this review with a neutral rating .#### #### ####[]
However , after being slightly bent it 's completely useless .#### #### ####[]
We bought these to charge our phones .#### #### ####[]
Wires were frayed as well .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'NEG')]

Fast charger , just as decribed Not even a week after purchase both stopped working .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
When I went to get a second one , I discovered it was a knock off , and it did n't work .#### #### ####[]
I also like the aluminum chassis .#### #### ####[]
Wish the branding were n't so obnoxious on the front as it has to sit out in my bedorom but works great#### #### ####[]
I ' ve never seen this error before with any cable ...#### #### ####[]
For me my outlets are installed horizontally so the USBs are sticking out of the side rather than the bottom .#### #### ####[]
Traveling a lot for work prevented me from returning this product within the time allotted .#### #### ####[]
I have finagled it but the watch doesn ’ t charge just sits there .#### #### ####[]
Bought 3 , one stopped working the same week we got it , second worked great for about 2 weeks , lets see how long the third works for .#### #### ####[]
After a year , the ports in the main block have deteriorated and the 60w USB-c charging port ( my most used ) is now super sensitive and will not charge consistently .#### #### ####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [11], 'NEG'), ([14, 15, 16, 17], [29, 30, 31], 'NEG'), ([14, 15, 16, 17], [25, 26], 'NEG')]

I loved this thing for 7 months—it did exactly what it was meant to do—and charging was really fast .#### #### ####[([15], [17, 18], 'POS')]
The charger works just as it ' s suppose to .#### #### ####[]
for $ 10 it ’ s good i just wouldn ’ t recommend if you intend to remove and reinsert it often#### #### ####[]
I tried this charger for multiple devices at once , and it was n't able to charge any of them .#### #### ####[]
One side doesn ’ t work and instructions are written so small I can ’ t read them .#### #### ####[([7], [9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]

My sons were happy with the 3 in 1 chargers as gifts .#### #### ####[]
Anyway so far it works for both my phone and my Galaxy Tab Pro 10 tablet , but its charging a lot slower than my original Samsung charger ( which funnily has the same specifications printed on the charger ).#### #### ####[([19], [22], 'NEG')]
This was a handy charger to keep on the counter BUT I bought it less than 6 months ago and it is already dead .#### #### ####[]
All of my things in one place with only one cord .#### #### ####[]
Sent a replacement and the replacement worked for 3 weeks and broke .#### #### ####[]
It works great with my Milanese Loop , but I had more problems with the band that came with it .#### #### ####[]
Both burned out in 4 months of occasional use .#### #### ####[]
This item is not as described and the lower magnet that ’ s meant to steady the phone doesn ’ t work as it doesn ’ t magnetise .#### #### ####[]
It kills me that some reviewers act as though they had no clue or idea this need a usb - c wall adapter ( most of the reviewers did not somehow know ).#### #### ####[]
If the phone is not sitting in the right spot then it will not charge .#### #### ####[]
Not a MagSafe compatible charger as advertised .#### #### ####[]
After 2 days , it died .#### #### ####[]
A great space saver for travel too .#### #### ####[]
But since I bought it to charge my watch I ’ m not the happiest#### #### ####[]
I plug it in , it charges for a minute , it stops charging .#### #### ####[]
But while it has the same specs as the previous one I had in my car for the past two or more years it charges my S10 + slower than it .#### #### ####[]
You do need to use a fast charge certified wall plug which I also purchased .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s an all in one for sure !#### #### ####[]
Buy a higher wattage one , it ’ s worth the extra money for it work right and not damage your phone .#### #### ####[]
Their customer service is exceptional .#### #### ####[]
Luckily got this on a lightning deal so no real damage .#### #### ####[]
12W is faster than this .#### #### ####[]
It is very hard to get the phone on just the right spot to charge and then when you lathe your hand off of the phone it looses it charge connection .#### #### ####[([29, 30], [27], 'NEG')]

it was very difficult to insert so if you will be taking it out often i wouldn ’ t recommend also i ’ m not sure if it ’ s the fault of my car or the charger but when inserting it it wouldn ’ t receive power at first but if a spin it a bit then it will start working and since it ’ s such a tight fit it will continue to work for a good amount of time .#### #### ####[]
I have one in my travel bag , one in my living room and one in my family room .#### #### ####[]
Doesn ’ t take up too much space and it ’ s easy to use .#### #### ####[]
I really like the feature .#### #### ####[]
This product has not worked .#### #### ####[]
I have an original Apple charger , one I ' ve owned for years , and it does not visibly spark when I plus it in .#### #### ####[]
One of the two plugs failed within a week , the others are good for now .#### #### ####[]
This device has a built-in fan that can get a bit loud if you have this sitting on a night stand near your head when sleeping in bed .#### #### ####[]
It is only practical if you can let it charge all night .#### #### ####[]

Seems to charge about as fast as my 24W Clever charger so not totally impressed with the 60W Anker .#### #### ####[]
Did n't charge and it took charge away#### #### ####[]
It works really well - fast charges my phone .#### #### ####[]
On the positive side , it seems to be another quality product from Anker , and to be able to handle different devices at the same time .#### #### ####[]
I really like how convenient this charging station is .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [4], 'POS')]
I have tried them in other outlets , took them to work , interchanged other cords/blocks .#### #### ####[]
i really like the style of the charging station overall , but now it ’ s kind of useless for charging my airpods when that was one of the reasons I got it .#### #### ####[]
What I do like about the charging pad is that it is faster than the cable that comes with the phone .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [12], 'POS')]
Took around 8-10 hours to charge them from 29-35 % to 100 % .#### #### ####[]
Waste of money , does n't even charge well , let alone fast .#### #### ####[]
Next one I will get will be a higher-powered unit for less critical placement and faster charge rate .#### #### ####[]
My gripes with this device are mostly with the smaller charging pad that is circular to match the size of the Galaxy Watch/Active series smart watches .#### #### ####[]
Another night it was at 80 % .#### #### ####[]
The GaN technology definitely results in a smaller charger .#### #### ####[([8], [7], 'NEG')]
A Dual Charger that is only 50 % dependable is not a dual charger .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]

If you 're looking for product longevity , this is not your item .#### #### ####[]
Luckily there 's a setting you can configure on your phone to prevent the phone from fast charging during certain times of the day which would prevent the fan in the charger from kicking on .#### #### ####[]
Figured it was just luck of the draw and was defective .#### #### ####[]

I understand that a fan is useful in these chargers , but , I would have thought they 'd have done something to minimize the sound coming from it Like I said , not even the gaming laptop I have makes this much noise and it has fans running near constantly to keep it cool .#### #### ####[]

While it seems to work well for other devices ( iPhone S7 , S7 plus , iPads , etc ) , the Anker charger is much larger and heavier than the original chargers : it is as large as four iPhone chargers together , and probably heavier ( I do not have a good scale to verify ; I will try to add photos later ) .#### #### ####[]
This “ charger ” does not charge past 90 % , absolutely useless and I would avoid buying it , I packaged it back up and it ’ s going back .#### #### ####[]
Well I like that the cable wires are long but they are slow on charging and it got hot on my first use being able to charge two phones at once is fantastic and using just one outlet I 'm just a little concern about the heat and hope it does n't ruin my phone I 'm going to use once more and if it heats up like that ad gain then I will have no choice but to return#### #### ####[([5, 6], [8], 'POS'), ([14], [12], 'NEG')]

I 'm supposed to endure this noise for 45 minutes for a 25 % charge ?#### #### ####[]
The power supplied by this unit is less than the power requirements of an iPad while in use , resulting in the slow discharge of the battery and an iPad without battery charge .#### #### ####[]

However ! … when it comes to the Apple Watch the stand/charger uses less amps , hence it takes longer to charge .#### #### ####[]
My old unit stayed on continuously .#### #### ####[]
I have an iPhone , Apple Watch , AirPods , and Apple pen and was tired of having 4 different cords plugged up taking up 2 outlets .#### #### ####[]

I bought it for compatibility .#### #### ####[]
Got tired of me having to replace my charger .#### #### ####[]
When it arrived in August 2021 , this unit charged my iPhone SE 2020 in a couple of hours .#### #### ####[]
I picked up these cords as well as a dual port USB car charger for car use .#### #### ####[]
This unit charges both our android and apple products quickly .#### #### ####[]
Phone must be placed perfectly on a small `` sweet spot '' in order for charging to be accomplished with a current-model iPhone .#### #### ####[]
Ever since , I 've noticed a small chirp/buzzing noise that was just inaudible enough that if I put in earplugs ( which I normally do anyway ) I could n't hear it .#### #### ####[]
It works really well and it ’ s great because instead of all the different cords you have to plug in there is only one cord and it charges everything at once .#### #### ####[]
And has input for your phone !#### #### ####[]
Stopped working in the first week .#### #### ####[]
We bought these because we needed the C adapters for our new phones and they charge really fast .#### #### ####[([15], [17], 'POS')]
This was easy to install right out of the box .#### #### ####[]
When I first bought this product one on the chargers died about a year in .#### #### ####[]
The charger recognizes the phone and starts charging right away .#### #### ####[]
I like the length of the cord .#### #### ####[]
I have an approved MagSafe case on it , which according to the description that is okay , and one slight movement my phone falls off .#### #### ####[]
First day out the box the light on the base stopped working but everything else worked as needed .#### #### ####[([6], [10, 11], 'NEG')]
It is a well made product and extremely simple to use , just plug it in and set your compatible phone on it .#### #### ####[]
Charger worked great for 8 months and then it died .#### #### ####[]

When I use the cable , even though it takes longer to charge the iPhone X , at least I could use the phone while it 's charging .#### #### ####[]
So this charging pad is faster BUT if your phone battery is LOW ( in the red ) , it will take hours to reach a full charge ( which is apparently expected from the iPhone X according to Apple users ... ugh ) .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [5], 'POS')]
You have to spend 30 minutes adjusting the position so it actually charges .... only for it to not be charged the next morning occasionally#### #### ####[]
But it just does n't seem to be built for any long-term use .#### #### ####[]
I had it charging for over an hour and it only charged 3 % ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
This is an amazing charging cube !#### #### ####[]
Currently I am having issues getting the charger to work when I turn it on .#### #### ####[]
The wires work well upon arrival but the blocks are beyond useless .#### #### ####[]
Was very excited to get this item and it worked great for about a year .#### #### ####[]
Would give 0 stars since it never worked - not even for a second .#### #### ####[]
I use it in my classroom , and I have a ChromeBook , two iPads , and a phone on it every day !#### #### ####[]
Finally , last night I got fed up and pinpointed the noise .#### #### ####[]
However after a week of use it simply stopped working .#### #### ####[]
It randomly turns off which is frustrating .#### #### ####[]
5 hours later the battery life was at 96 % .#### #### ####[]
It does charge though ( really slowly ) .#### #### ####[]
I really like the lights in the ports and it ’ s been a pretty solid charger#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [2], 'POS')]

I bought this Anker charger as an alternative to carrying multiple chargers on trips .#### #### ####[]
Doesn ’ t seem to charge quickly#### #### ####[]
If the design is and was for the charger to work only one day it needs to be specified clearly in the description .#### #### ####[]
I don ’ t use it to do my Apple Watch… unfortunately !#### #### ####[]
As soon it reached I put my AirPods on charging and my AirPods case is not getting charge now .Just after 2 days I received this charger the place for phone charger stopped working .#### #### ####[]
The charger worked for 2 days before it no longer charged anything .#### #### ####[]
2 hours have gone by and my iPhone X only gained a 40 % charge .#### #### ####[]
I like the product design .#### #### ####[]
This charger was great while it lasted but less than a month after having it both of the chargers stopped working .#### #### ####[]
I like the concept of the 4 in 1 however I will not be able to use it and will regift it , didn ’ t realize it ’ s not comparable with my iPhone 7Plus , had a hard time getting the Apple Watch cord to fit and close the storage space , it ’ s not worth it for me and use only for air pods which is the only thing I would have use for .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [1], 'POS')]
Now it ’ s not charging properly .#### #### ####[]
Used only on surge protector .#### #### ####[]

The silicone finish is smooth and thick .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [6], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [4], 'POS')]
I ’ ll place my phone on the charger before I go to bed and make sure that it ’ s working , but when I wake up the phone is not charged .#### #### ####[]
With that said , I am aware that the second charging pad can be used to charge a second phone ( or a wireless ear buds with a wireless charging case ) so maybe that 's why they decided to not make that one magnetic .#### #### ####[]
My phone needs the extra protection , and I do not want to wear out the sealing tab over the plug port , a weakness for any self-hinge design .#### #### ####[]
It wasn ’ t compatible with my iphone#### #### ####[]
I 'm super disappointed that this is 90 $ and is so irritatingly loud .#### #### ####[]
I 've tried charging with 2 different cases on and it wo n't charge in a case .#### #### ####[]
Third , it 's small - it 's smaller than my mouse and fits in the palm of my hand .#### #### ####[]
I also like the three slots this charger has , very efficient .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [11], 'POS')]
I used the adhesion method to attach the device to my car .#### #### ####[]
The cords do seem kinda short , but I ’ m not using them anyways .#### #### ####[([1], [5], 'NEG')]
It has the adapter for the newer model MacBooks and also has a USB port .#### #### ####[]
Their product work great for the first week then one stop working and then another one stop working now I only have one left that works#### #### ####[]
The charger should have cut out far before that point .#### #### ####[]
Almost exactly a month after purchase both the blocks and cables no longer work .#### #### ####[]
Ever since I got this single plug in , my side table looks so much cleaner !#### #### ####[]
The only thing I had playing was the white noise I sleep to , but even with that , I 've always woken up to a fully charged phone .#### #### ####[]
Works great and the charging light turns off after it starts charging so it won ’ t keep you awake !#### #### ####[]
It has offered a solution to taking multiple plugs to charge multiple devices at the same time .#### #### ####[]
Charges quickly and does not get warm .#### #### ####[]
The one that works , works great .#### #### ####[]
Now if your phone battery charge is at 50 % or more , the pad will charge it very quickly .#### #### ####[]
Got this to use as a stand and not deal with the drama of cords breaking down .#### #### ####[]
Works great -- except the lip the phone sits on is too small to find easily in the dark ( as when I 'm going to sleep ) .#### #### ####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
It arrived , I plugged it in and set my phone on it , which was at 3 % .#### #### ####[]
Note * I used it for my iPhone 12 and air pods and I takes a long time to charge and it heats up bad ! !#### #### ####[]
I wouldn ’ t even care if it charged slow because I was only looking for something to charge my phone at night , but what ’ s the point if it ’ s not charging at all about 75 % of the time .#### #### ####[]
Additionally , the actual wall plug in is smaller than the normal apple charger , making it a better size to leave in my backpack .#### #### ####[]
When it comes to chargers and cables you just want them to work , and these do n't .#### #### ####[]
It has a bright blue light that ’ s distracting to sleep .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5], [9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
However , I wonder if the `` Non-Slip Ring '' that 's sitting on charger could be more catered towards phones with a protruding rear camera because the camera bump on my phone is causing the ring to complete avoid the phone .#### #### ####[]
The product would not charge my device .#### #### ####[]
Went bad after a short time .#### #### ####[]
Yet the same devices charge fine directly in same wall outlet ( example ThermaCell , portable chargers and hearing aids )#### #### ####[]
I bought these and 2 did not work at all .#### #### ####[]
The cord is ridiculously short .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
Fortunately I did not pay for this charger standalone ; it came with my 28600 mAh Anker power bank , and the charger only has one USB-C charging port .#### #### ####[]
I have a Pixel 2XL and an iPhone 8 and it 'll fast charge both of them at the same time without getting so much as warm .#### #### ####[]
I 'd buy a flat charger except I really like the phone sitting up so I can see the clock at night .#### #### ####[]
And the best part about this is it will blink if you do n't have one of your items on correctly .#### #### ####[]
While using it says fast charging but it takes almost much longer to charge the phone than the original charger .#### #### ####[]
Works for iPhone 13 and compatible MagSafe cases .#### #### ####[]
I recommend the BatPower 120W version .#### #### ####[]
I use it in conjunction with a 8ft fast charging cable , together , my phone charges freon 30 % while driving and using gps map service , to 67 % in about 25 minutes .#### #### ####[]
The cord is super thin half the thickness of my old one and the cord is not 6 ft long like it says it is .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
It said both were charging so I left and came back 30 minutes later to them being no more charged than when I left .#### #### ####[]

I finally decided to purchase this wireless charger not just to save money from buying new charging wires , but also to keep them off their phones for just a little bit while it ’ s charging .#### #### ####[]

It 's got this high pitched whir that I can hear over the the TV and everything else in the room .#### #### ####[]
Not sure what happened ... was not dropped or disturbed in any way .#### #### ####[]
Within five minutes and it doesn ’ t even charge enough .#### #### ####[]
I bought one of these , and it broke within two weeks when the exterior plastic cracked at the seam between the narrow and wide sections of it .#### #### ####[]
I even removed my slim clear OtterBox Symmetry case because I was in rust for a fast charge ( and it is a pain to get that case off and back on again ) .#### #### ####[]
They worked for about a week !#### #### ####[]
I used them for my wireless duo and they will charge my watch but not my phone so it 's just ok#### #### ####[]
Have not had them go missing since my purchase#### #### ####[]
Plugged in to another and nothing .#### #### ####[]
It is so easy to use and I love it .#### #### ####[]
I noticed it ( Apple Watch ) usually roughly stops about 75 % to 80 % and I would have to pick it up for about 10 to 15 seconds then place it back down and it will start back charging , and I ’ ll get it to charge to about 90 to 98 % .⁣#### #### ####[]

It does n't come with an actual plug for the cable , and the voltage and wattage requirements are specific , so you have to look and make sure an existing USB plug that you have will work .#### #### ####[]
As far as what I use it for , I mostly just use it to charge my iPhone ( and use the stand ) and charge my AirPods .#### #### ####[]

I couldn ’ t get them to charge I knew straight away something wasn ’ t right when it says the case is charged and the ear buds aren ’ t .#### #### ####[]
Something that would stay in my ears and I wouldn ’ t even need to touch it to adjust or not let it fall .#### #### ####[]
Use them for work primary ( remote work still ) and they ’ re very comfortable .#### #### ####[]

Given the price point , these earbuds are superb quality .#### #### ####[]
Huge Cons : I dont have an Apple phone , so I use it on my Note 20 , theirs a huge problem , 10 % of the time only 1 side of the headphones plays and I tried everything to fix it , sadly a complete uninstall from saved bluetooth is only fix which is VERY annoying if you 're in the gym .#### #### ####[]
If you want higher sound quality , then definitely insert the ear plugs that come with it .#### #### ####[]

Run through all their reset tests just to humor myself .#### #### ####[]
They where great , till left ear stoped charging#### #### ####[]
Only use them for work and I have multiple headsets so it ’ s not getting all they much use .#### #### ####[]
I test them on a another 30 minute run - fine .#### #### ####[]
Love the sound that comes from these !#### #### ####[]
Just losing battery life because i had them over 3 years .#### #### ####[]
This is my first pair of wireless earbuds .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m catching up on my podcasts , answering calls ; all while hearing my surrounding & staying in touch with people around me .#### #### ####[]
Disclaimer : I know these are n't designed for that purpose ....#### #### ####[]

Update Sept 13th - had these around 2.5 months .#### #### ####[]
They feel pretty sturdy so hopefully they last a long while .#### #### ####[]
Much of the time , I found the mic resting on my shirt which muffled my voice .#### #### ####[([8], [14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]

It is more snug , better at cancelling out outside noise , and far more comfortable than I ever would have imagined .#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9, 10], [5], 'POS')]
They shouldn ’ t hurt to put in .#### #### ####[]
I ’ ve used them about 4 times at the gym and still at 60 % battery .#### #### ####[]
Changing track 2 taps and volume 3 taps .#### #### ####[]
So these ear buds where pretty decent when I first receive them , the sound quality was good the noise cancellation was good and the battery life was ok I ’ ve had better but I felt they where perfect for use at work and didn ’ t cost as much as the most popular ear buds .#### #### ####[([14, 15], [17], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [22], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [28], 'POS')]
The software is a pain to use .#### #### ####[([1], [4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
The reason I bought this was because I wanted to see if I could use earbuds that had hooks , these would not fit in my ear unless they forced in and the sound was very poor because they wouldn ’ t fit properly , but that could just be the shape of my ears .#### #### ####[([33], [36], 'NEG')]
The charge lasts a long time .#### #### ####[]
Of course I have used this calendar , but will be returning it because it is assembled incorrectly .#### #### ####[]
This is especially annoying when you are out doing things wearing them and you don ’ t have the case nearby and then you can ’ t even use them anymore until you get back to the case .#### #### ####[]
As many have reported , the charging case is much smaller than Bose and fits much easier into front jeans pocket .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [10], 'POS')]

I tried to clean the ports and make sure they are in the charging case properly but to no avail .#### #### ####[]

Yes I even updated the firmware from apple.com/dre beats and talked to Apple .#### #### ####[]
I assume that the extra heft is to hold the additional weight that the SoundSport earpieces have .#### #### ####[]
I decided to upgrade to the 3 's , expecting they would also be a great fit .#### #### ####[]

Product broke right away , I had to buy new ones 3 days later#### #### ####[]
They didn ’ t come with a charger or even a usable cable , I just got a short USB to USB adapter cable and no wall mounted charger at all .#### #### ####[]
I did n't need anything spectacular aside from staying in my ears when doing simple tasks and working out .#### #### ####[]
I get about 10-12 hours per charge for reference .#### #### ####[]
the buds do n't snap into the case so well , you kinda have to make sure they 're charging .#### #### ####[([19], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

The next day when I turned them on , it stated they were at 90 % power .#### #### ####[]
It sounds like an open microphone with the wind blowing over it , so most of the time when jogging I run with it in OFF mode .#### #### ####[]
Poor fit : No matter how much I adjusted the ear buds , they would not sit comfortably in my ears .#### #### ####[]
The sound quality is fantastic and I love the fact that they work so well with my phone with regard to clarity of calls and ability to text through them .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS'), ([21, 22, 23], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([25, 26, 27], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS')]
The wire casing is pretty concerning for longevity , but this has always been a problem with Bose 's earbuds ; I 'll probably wind up reinforcing it with some macrame like I did with my old wired ones .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
My issue is I am constantly having to push them back in my ears because they do n't stay .#### #### ####[]
The music also comes across very detailed and dynamic .#### #### ####[([1], [8], 'POS'), ([1], [6], 'POS')]
I can sit and analyze sound signatures all day , but sometimes I want to put in a set of headphones , and simply enjoy music .#### #### ####[]
Sounds decent , the bass is lacking a bit and the battery died faster than advertised#### #### ####[]
Went to the apple website and they fix they offer does not work .#### #### ####[]
The silicone on the prior models was WAY better and allowed for a better fit .#### #### ####[]

Also , the uni-size fit could be better , they need readjustment while running but at least do n't fall out like other ear buds .#### #### ####[]
For some reason when taking them out of the charger pack .#### #### ####[]
The T6 is excellent in terms of comfort , sound quality and fit - but I must say the T12 takes these wireless earbuds to the next level .#### #### ####[([7], [3], 'POS'), ([12], [3], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [3], 'POS')]
But still I got the same inflammation and itchiness after taking them off even for 1 hour periods of wear .#### #### ####[([19], [6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
I called Bose and they declared them defective .#### #### ####[]
I know you can change the size of the pieces but because they are soft , they bend and flex as you move and easily fall out .#### #### ####[]
The only thing I don ’ t care for is the ear pieces don ’ t hold in your ear as good as previous models .#### #### ####[]
Control scheme is weird and not intuitive compared to other earbuds ( double instead of single tap to pause and only on the right bud even when only using left ) .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [5, 6], 'NEG')]

These would become loose and I would end up having to push in to keep from falling out .#### #### ####[]
At first I really liked the Aeropex ( over the Air ) due to the IPX water proof rating and better sound quality curve .#### #### ####[]
You would think this company would at least look at the reviews and replace the product if it ’ s not typical of only a month and a half of use !#### #### ####[]
To describe it with just one word , the sound is RICH !#### #### ####[([9], [11], 'POS')]
The best is all the different options you can set up to personify them .#### #### ####[]

I work with loud equipment so noise cancelation is important .#### #### ####[]
The words `` for no reason '' has seriously impaired its functionality , even without any touching or any wind blowing .#### #### ####[]
I think it 's trying to be `` smart '' by detecting the outside noise , but I can not figure out how to keep it off of noise cancelling permanently when I run .#### #### ####[]
excellent paring every time and easy to pair initially .#### #### ####[]
When I Bought my 1st apple product a year ago airpods gen 2 I could not believe how good they sounded ( to me at least )#### #### ####[]
However I noticed on a plane ride a few weeks ago that I was getting unusual interruption of music playback .#### #### ####[]

Also to volume would change frequently over an hour .#### #### ####[([2], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]

i 'm pretty sure one of them broke after barely being used ( the 'touch volume ' situation on ones of the buds does n't work ) and over all they 're a waste of time .#### #### ####[]

I got these for my 14 year old son and he really likes them and said it has great sound for his online school .#### #### ####[]

I ’ m one of those people who can ’ t do the shape of the Apple earbuds , and these are so comfortable .#### #### ####[]
They are comfortable and light. , but that about it .#### #### ####[]
After a few months the left ear stopped .#### #### ####[]
Good parts are great sound quality , amazing active noise cancellation , battery lasts way longer than expected , very comfortable even after hours of continuous use .#### #### ####[]
The mic sounds decent for phone calls , but only if the mic is positioned in a particular way .#### #### ####[]
That ’ s total design failure by Bose .#### #### ####[]
I have Samsung earbuds , but they do n't always stay in when moving around - my ears are small so none of the bud really work .#### #### ####[]
And the noise cancellation doesn ’ t compare with Bose clearly superior .#### #### ####[]
They stick out from they ear way far and make it difficult to wear a beanie or knit cap .#### #### ####[]
the oval shape is very hard to find .#### #### ####[]

I absolutely love my headphones… they are comfortable and very quality… best money I ’ ve spent all year and they were on sale 😩😊#### #### ####[]

You can power them off by holding down on ear buds , but you ca n't power them back on without the case .#### #### ####[]

I had replaced my Bose QC-30 yearly for 3 years for free ( under warranty ) before the third headset physically broke in half leading to replacement purchase of Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds with super satisfying results until they stopped working after 6 months .#### #### ####[]
Connected easily to my iPhone .#### #### ####[]
I used mine a few times now and with in the first month the right bud had sound loss and after that it lost sound completely in the 3rd month .#### #### ####[]
6 hours later , the `` amber '' light was still blinking .#### #### ####[]

You also ca n't adjust the volume on them without using your phone .#### #### ####[]
I 've had 10 dollar wirless earbuds that sound a million times better and last a work shift and school classes .#### #### ####[]
I even changed our the plugs to biggest hoping they would stay in as I did n't have a problem with the galaxy buds ( poor sound noise cancelation ) .#### #### ####[]

The fit is great because you do n't feel them after a while .#### #### ####[]
I have had no issue with my pair .#### #### ####[]
I use the earbuds for probably 8-12 hours a day .#### #### ####[]
The reason for a 3 star rating is mainly due to it pause frequently for no reason , sometimes outdoor and sometimes indoor .#### #### ####[]

The Bass Is Even More Punchy Than The Gen 2 Was And The Gen 3 Seems Louder As Well Without Adjusting The Volume During My Listening Tests .#### #### ####[]
Itchy : Something about the silicone really irritated my ear and made it super itchy , so on top of having a hard time getting them to stay in my ear ( let alone get a good fit ) , the inside of my ear would start to itch so bad I had to take it out .#### #### ####[([5], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]

At first I thought maybe I 'm just not putting them in right , but over a 5hr period I literally tried every angle possible , and 1. they do n't stay in my ears 2. takes about 3min before my ears start to hurt , and 3. maybe they just do n't fit my ears enough but the sound quality is not much better unless I shove them in and hold it their while it hurts .#### #### ####[([59, 60], [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69], 'NEG')]

They will constantly disconnect after 20 % and just wo n't work .#### #### ####[]

It quite often does n't register that you 've removed the headphones from the case , so you have to place them back and try again , sometimes more than once .#### #### ####[]

Sound quality is n't great ... but I 'm not sure how it could be better without covering your ears .#### #### ####[]
They are n't painful on the ears at all , but they might fall a little if they do n't fit snuggly .#### #### ####[]

The battery life estimate is roughly correct .#### #### ####[]
I read several older reviews where people had faulty units with a malfunctioning earpiece overtime .#### #### ####[]

When you turn off the noise cancellation by tapping the left ear piece , sound from the outside world go straight through the headphones .#### #### ####[]

These earbuds have great sound quality and bass .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [3], 'POS')]
They ’ re not so expensive that if you lose one or your child steals them you can ’ t buy another set , but they work well enough that I don ’ t need to spend $ 100+ for those name brand ones .#### #### ####[]

There is a quality depth and warmth to the music that is better than I have ever heard on Bluetooth in-ear headphones .#### #### ####[([9], [6], 'POS'), ([9], [3, 4], 'POS')]
Everything feels solid and built for abuse .#### #### ####[]
which you rarely have to do because a simple larger ear tip size will cancel any background noise .#### #### ####[]
The earbuds themselves look new but were77 definitely touched by someone else before .#### #### ####[]
Now I have TWO dead Aeropex .#### #### ####[]
The voice fails miserably at pronouncing the names of all of my devices ( though I guess we ca n't blame any technology for the ambiguity that is English pronunciation ) .#### #### ####[]
Easy to pair once I figured out the confusing instructions .#### #### ####[]
The right ear bud ca n't be charge for more then 10 minutes and its sucks so hard#### #### ####[]
The battery life is actually quite long compared to other headphones .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [6], 'POS')]
I thought it was because I was using a wireless charger so I purchased a corded charger specifically for these buds and put them on charge overnight and they still didn ’ t receive a full charge .#### #### ####[]
The only thing the stupid voice accomplishes is to irritate me .#### #### ####[([5], [9], 'NEG')]
Overall , these are really 4-star headphones that are saved by stylish good looks and a fun and lively sound which makes them a solid product .#### #### ####[([19], [16], 'POS'), ([19], [18], 'POS')]
Today the light is gone and the headphones are still unresponsive .#### #### ####[([7], [10], 'NEG')]
The `` amber '' flashing light came on and I thought all was well .#### #### ####[]
So far so good , I think there is a little awkward , since they 're bigger than the one I used to wear , but that 's does n't matter a lot when sound quality it 's good and the microphone is also on point .#### #### ####[([34, 35], [38], 'POS'), ([16], [11], 'NEG')]
First of all the fit , appearance and overall physical qualities of the earphones are fine , no complaints .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [15], 'POS'), ([6], [15], 'POS')]
I tested them out on a short run and they worked fine ( 30 minutes ) .#### #### ####[]
I wish they would have worked better .#### #### ####[]
Small Cons : There is no nose cancelation but the rubber tips does block out about 95 % of sound so its ok .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'POS')]
I spoke to Bose customer service who helped me troubleshoot and they confirmed it was a defective set .#### #### ####[]

I tried talking to someone with the microphone on PC and phone , and they said the microphone was horrible and they had trouble understanding me at times ( walking around my quiet house ) .#### #### ####[([17], [19], 'NEG')]
Loved the price of these and figured since it was so inexpensive , they wouldn ’ t be great BUT , every pair worked great and my kids LOVE them ! ! !#### #### ####[]
When I am walking around in the headphones , there are bursts of digital noise in the headphones , or they would skip a few beats , like it was is trying to catch up to the song .#### #### ####[([17], [22, 23, 24, 25], 'NEG'), ([17], [11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
Touchy controls , little customization : Given the fact that I had to constantly adjust the ear buds to get a good fit , I was constantly skipping forward and backward on my podcasts , pausing my music , and accidentally hanging up on people .#### #### ####[]
Take shirt off and accidently brush against the earbuds and they go crazy , changing volume levels .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [14, 15, 16], 'NEG'), ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [11, 12], 'NEG')]
They look good too , because they 're vertical , not horizontally sticking out .#### #### ####[]
I was very impressed with the sound quality .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [3], 'POS')]
They were fine for about a week , then stopped working in one ear .#### #### ####[]
The loudest setting sits at least two notches below what I want to listen to and would randomly go super quiet .#### #### ####[]
So , my wife wondered why her music was no longer audible on her computer and I was confounded by the mystery music on my headset .#### #### ####[]
The pros are more comfortable and more quality .#### #### ####[]
I realize that consumers rated them high but they are much worse than others that i have priced about the same Case is not made to seal has openings on the back two slashes bad design#### #### ####[]
They state the battery lasts for 8 hours ; however both pairs shut off without any prior notice when they reach 20 % battery .#### #### ####[]
( They are also not as picky about sound curve or need waterproofing . )#### #### ####[]
I absolutely LOVE the way these fit .#### #### ####[([6], [2], 'POS')]
2 days later , put them in the charger ; `` amber '' light comes on like it says is supposed to , charged them for 3 hours and yet again charge does not go to `` green '' .#### #### ####[]
The sound quality is great .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS')]
They just disconnect and connect back again .#### #### ####[]
Good sound , good battery life#### #### ####[]
I thought these might work , but today they COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING !#### #### ####[]
Just about get it to pause which is 1 tap .#### #### ####[]
I loved the idea of having each bud be independent , but when trying to turn up volume I had to do it individually which is a pain .#### #### ####[([15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], [27], 'NEG')]

You can select whether or not you want to be able to triple tap to skip backwards , but not change it to double tapping to skip backwards .#### #### ####[]
Can see dirty thing on the earphones#### #### ####[]
The first few months were fine , they were of decent quality and while the microphone was n't great , it was about the same quality of previous pairs from other brands .#### #### ####[]
I can hear , but the other person can not hear .#### #### ####[]
The wind noise reduction does n't work at all .#### #### ####[]
They are lightweight and I can wear them all day without ear fatigue .#### #### ####[]
Seems very weak and the connection skips out when my phone isn ’ t in direct view of the earpieces .#### #### ####[]
I really thought I ’ d like the Gen 3 but I found they don ’ t stay in the ears which means I ’ ll probably lose them easily .#### #### ####[]
DOES NOT FIT IN MY STYLO 5 ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
They perfect do n't fall out pretty comfortable in ear .#### #### ####[]
One time instead of paring them it would shut them off .#### #### ####[]
I love these headphones when they are working properly , but they have their issues#### #### ####[]
But these are very comfortable to wear .#### #### ####[]
However , I 've had these headphones for two months and my right headphone just stopped working .#### #### ####[([11, 12, 13], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
I lost one of the earbuds for the first pair .#### #### ####[]
But what 's stranger is that I only started noticing this with the iPhone 6s I was issued several weeks ago to replace my company-provided 5s .#### #### ####[]
So , if you do n't have the case with you and you need to power them on , you 're screwed .#### #### ####[]
Display which shows remaining battery is also useful .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [7], 'POS')]

I Purchase these for Black Friday and immediately had connection issues with the first pair so I warrantee returned them for another pair and they had the same exact connection issues so I returned the second pair as well and got a full refund .#### #### ####[]
the wired version of these fit my ears better somehow .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
If you already own other Bose speakers , then you will appreciate that the company 's rich sound signature has not been lost on this wireless pair of sport headphones .#### #### ####[]
I had to adjust my equalizer on Music Bee to 10 band , then added the Pre-Amp ! !#### #### ####[]
I switch around between these and studio and beats pro depending on the activity#### #### ####[]
Everything works as expected for the price point , but these do not stay put in my ears when moving about , like a workout#### #### ####[]

Need to listen to a broader sample of musical genres to really do that justice .#### #### ####[]
I was looking for earbuds that I could use while running or riding my bike .#### #### ####[]
These headphones could pass as a Bose headphones in terms of sound quality , so if you like Bose get Bose or else if you like to call them Sony get these , where ’ s the signature Sony bass ?#### #### ####[]
The buds are able to sense when you take them out of your ear and turn off whatever audio is playing , just don ’ t be surprised when the other bud is out and in your pocket or against something .#### #### ####[]
And when on Android , the one touch assistant button lets me connect to my Alexa app and when on MacBook , It connects to Siri .#### #### ####[]
Rich sound for both treble and bass .#### #### ####[([4], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([6], [0, 1], 'POS')]

Either way the transparency didn ’ t feel as overwhelming and the noise cancellation seemed smoother .#### #### ####[]
Understandable as the earpieces house a battery , Bluetooth antenna , buttons and other electronics .#### #### ####[]
On the off chance that you can get the earbuds to connect the sound quality is fine .#### #### ####[]
Con : The controls are on the main part of the 'elbow ' so when you adjust into your ear , they will play music or hang up your call .#### #### ####[]
Controls , I don ’ t have fat fingers or particularly tiny fingers .#### #### ####[]

First pair lasted a week before it shut off and would not turn back on , would not even charge , just stopped working .#### #### ####[]
Only one ear would connect and play music .#### #### ####[]

You have to PAY to view your own cameras on your own wifi longer than 5 minutes .#### #### ####[]
You cant set a schedule by camera only by sync module so that sucks bad , so you will get a lot of unnecessary alerts , but they did add per camera snooze which was a great add .#### #### ####[]

The annoying this is , I 've seen so many conflicting reviews about how to wash after a while .#### #### ####[]
1 month it worked well and easy to put on the bed .#### #### ####[]
It is also easy to bleach if needed .#### #### ####[]
Which allows me to alternate between black or gray , depending on the color sheets and pillow cases I have on the bed .#### #### ####[]
It gave me that feeling of sheets being crimped up and jabbing at your back .#### #### ####[]

Wonderful soft like a cloud#### #### ####[]
Crunchy , noisy , not worth the price .#### #### ####[]
It 's as flat as a pancake .#### #### ####[]
This was advertised as “ cool ” but I have been just as hot as I was with my last mattress pad .#### #### ####[]
Very light weight and soft .#### #### ####[]
For me , it turns out causing a rift in my marriage !#### #### ####[]
Covered my queen size mattress like a glove .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s soft to touch but if you ’ re looking for something more pillowy this is not it .#### #### ####[]
It definitely protects the mattress .#### #### ####[]
feathers are coming out of it abd ita only been a month#### #### ####[]
It had me waking up throughout the night because of how hot it got .#### #### ####[]
I had a comforter on my bed prior to receiving this and I believe it made my bed softer than this thing .#### #### ####[]
Also , definitely a dirty looking off white color .#### #### ####[]
When I get into bed when this is been on for an hour prior my feet don ’ t feel the heat and it takes me hours to get warm enough I wish there was a setting to turn the temperature down after so much time#### #### ####[]
The concept that Biorithms can be named and also assigned to the numbered M1 , M2 , M3 buttons is grossly over-engineered .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [20, 21], 'NEG')]
I thought maybe once my husband and I were on our bed it would stay , but as soon as we laid our two year old on it , it instantly collapsed folding in between our mattress .#### #### ####[]
I can see why they say `` lightweight '' because theres not anything there !#### #### ####[]
It feels like I just put another comforter to lay on .#### #### ####[]
It is good quality for the price .#### #### ####[]
Not too heavy and not too light but the length and width does seem to run small .#### #### ####[]
I woke up drenched in sweat and have been contemplating returning because of how comfortable it is , but it 's too hot for me to keep .#### #### ####[]
It held up for a year , thought it would last a little longer at least .#### #### ####[]
I had to get a duvet just to stop it .#### #### ####[]
And it says thickness is almost 2 ” , it doesn ’ t even measure up to an inch .#### #### ####[]
This would be perfect for a child ’ s bed since it is basically a plastic tarp with fabric over it .#### #### ####[]
I like softer beds so this only adds to it .#### #### ####[]
It starts at about 85 degrees then goes up .#### #### ####[]
I unraveled it and let it just breathe for 24 hrs and fluffed it by hand each square individually but you can tell that it ’ s not really filled properly .#### #### ####[]
This mattress cover is comfortable but not waterproof like I thought .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [6, 7], 'NEG')]

This would be a great product if the foam attached to the underside middle inseam was a hard type of material .#### #### ####[]
It was so fluffy that I could not wait to sleep on it .#### #### ####[]

The whole thing collapses with any kind of weight .#### #### ####[]
Maybe the material gets softer with washing ... time will tell .#### #### ####[]
I primarily bought this because the product description claims it has cooling qualities .#### #### ####[]
This comforter is not lightweight at all .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4], 'NEG')]
I found it slipping quite a lot , and was often sweating under it#### #### ####[]
Definitely not as fluffy as appears in picture .#### #### ####[]
In the summertime this would be great because it 's light weight .#### #### ####[]
It fits more like a queen .#### #### ####[]
Great quality , very warm , totally recomended .#### #### ####[]
Once you get under it , there is n't much left to cover your body , let alone share with your spouse .#### #### ####[]
It is well made and attractive and with a good softness and comfort .#### #### ####[]
In fact puffier than I expected .#### #### ####[]
A big waste of money as these are so crinkly they can ’ t be used for camping or even as an extra TV blanket for the sofa .#### #### ####[]
No way would this be warm enough on its own in winter .#### #### ####[]
Just like sleeping on the mattress with no topper .#### #### ####[]
Took me some months to realized it was this the main reason of my night sweats .#### #### ####[]
My verdict : hardware is decent , but it 's controlling software is unusable garbage .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [13, 14], 'NEG')]

It just folds into the crack between the beds .#### #### ####[]
They ’ re not soft and assuredly they are not comfortable .#### #### ####[]
It is wrinkle free and so soft .#### #### ####[]
I sleep in a bunk bed , and even though I have a long-haired cat , I feel like I have n't needed to wash it , but I do notice that the comforter is super limp .#### #### ####[([33], [36], 'POS')]

Very comfortable and easy to slip into a duvet insert , but very hot .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s comfortable , soft and warms me up quick when I ’ m cold .#### #### ####[]
It requires a triple washer and a very long drying time .#### #### ####[]
I ordered the beige and it ’ s a very warm beige tone almost a little flesh colored ?#### #### ####[]
It fluffs right back up after dryer .#### #### ####[]
Also , the fabric is already pilling only after a month .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]

The pic looks all fluffy and huge and this comforter is the total opposite .#### #### ####[]
It is soft and works otherwise !#### #### ####[]
But the fact that the first time in the laundry , the polyfill ( or whatever is in the puffy sections ) in several of them balled up .#### #### ####[]

Fancy sounding Biorithm feature supposed to provide minimal programming to switch the settings by timer .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [0, 1], 'NEG')]
The top part is made of cotton which is good , however , the rest of material is thin polyester , that makes the whole product look cheap and poor quality .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [9], 'POS'), ([16], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], 'NEG'), ([16], [29, 30], 'NEG')]

Loses it 's snug fit on our ( Tempurpedic ) King mattress in a couple of months which means we are regularly , daily having to pull it back down around the mattress so our sheets do n't bunch up .#### #### ####[]

It is so soft it fits well , it is a good buy , so nice thank you ,#### #### ####[]
Update : after a few days , all the stuffing fell to one side .#### #### ####[]

I got this to replace my mattress pad , but it was so thin that I just put it on top of my old mattress pad .#### #### ####[]
This was for my son and he loved how comfortable it is. &#### #### ####[]
It ’ s a lot warmer than what I thought it would be .#### #### ####[]
Sort of uneven and it ’ s thin all over .#### #### ####[]
But it never fluffed back up .#### #### ####[]
Holding up very well a year later .#### #### ####[]
Awesome quality at a low price#### #### ####[]
Its like sleeping on a cloud .#### #### ####[]
I ordered a queen and I thought I was gon na rip it when trying to put it on .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s definitely not as thick as the pictures make it out too be .#### #### ####[]

I live in Jamaica but i love to snuggle in bed when the nights are cold and this is light weight enough for the summer , it 's so soft and such great quality .#### #### ####[]
It definitely flattens on side you sleep .#### #### ####[]
I definitely think a queen would have fit but the king has a little extra on each side which is nice .#### #### ####[]
This is like sleeping under a cloud .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s more of a sheet than a pillow .#### #### ####[]
It leaked right into the matress .#### #### ####[]
Similar products I have had have been much more effective with longer effect .#### #### ####[]
Within 2 weeks , the protective plastic started flaking off .#### #### ####[]

My husband uses his side just to warm it up to crawl in , then he turns it off .#### #### ####[]
It is heavy and doesn ’ t fall off of you .#### #### ####[]
This is noiseless and has a soft quilting on top .#### #### ####[]
I am not sure why I was expecting more for the price that this was , but the material is very cheap .#### #### ####[([18], [21], 'NEG')]
It ’ s the right weight for someone who wants the comfort of being tucked in yet not hot at all !#### #### ####[]
I love using it more in the winter , but it 's a dream to sleep under .#### #### ####[]

Great light for reading or doing crafts .#### #### ####[]

Max brightness is brighter than I expected and is highly adjustable to get the perfect amount of light .#### #### ####[]

Unfortunately , the light is not very bright ( ca n't really be seen from outside , not that it 's important ) and the remove is a typical generic remote that may conflict with any other lighting-based-controllers you have .#### #### ####[([3], [5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
We recently downsized to a new home and found that much of our furniture was just too bulky and that included my husbands living room side table with a large lamp .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s pretty simple to put together .#### #### ####[]

Turn this on at night is beautiful#### #### ####[]
Just tried to put it together and this one does not work either .#### #### ####[]
Also , I do n't have young children in my home that makes me scared of it being accidentally knocked over .#### #### ####[]

Pretty easy to assemble but piece of junk#### #### ####[]
Figuring out how to put it together was n't hard , twisting the pieces together was difficult and sometimes did n't go together correctly so I just put WD40 on a QTip and greased the inside of the pipes where the two ends met and it went together very well and fast .#### #### ####[([11, 12, 13, 14], [16], 'NEG')]

Bright color , lots of color modes and a timer setting !#### #### ####[]

Item was broken when I received it , returned for a refund .#### #### ####[]

I also like the color temperature adjustment to get the right light depending on my needs , although I mainly stick to the bright and soft white settings .#### #### ####[]
It looks nice but it could be a bit sturdier .#### #### ####[]

If I , a 69 year old woman , can assemble this lamp , anyone can !#### #### ####[]
But there are a few things that I do need to comment on and that is that when you first start off , you must pull the bottom cable out until you ca n't do anymore .#### #### ####[]
Seems to be not quite straight ; would prefer more brightness levels .#### #### ####[]
The first part of the pipe ( Part B ) has a thread at the angle , therefore the whole lamp would stand at an angle .#### #### ####[]
The bulb that came with it is stronger light than I really need so I put in a less-bright LED .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m surprised at the actual difference between the lighting modes , I expected it to be minimal , but the warm light feels just like an old incandescent bulb ( that ’ s a compliment ) , and the LEDs are LEDs ( fine ) .#### #### ####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [3], 'POS')]
It tips over at the slightest bump .#### #### ####[]

I have to find something to sit on the back of it to keep it balanced .#### #### ####[]
Not a bad price and I can switch the lamp shades .#### #### ####[]
It is impossible for an adult to assemble this , as no one can fit their hands inside the shades to screw in the stabilizing rings .#### #### ####[]
I like being able to choose between a white or a softer light .#### #### ####[]
Its decent and classic ... Not too good or too bad ...#### #### ####[]
The one thing I was not very happy with was that the lamp was so dim .#### #### ####[([12], [15], 'NEG')]
The welds weren ’ t very stable and broke apart .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG'), ([1], [8, 9], 'NEG')]
Maybe wish it went a little bit higher but we ’ re happy with the way it fits into our room#### #### ####[]
Needed a light so could see music .#### #### ####[]
The floor lamp did not have adjustable height , so it was important that the magnifying light was adjustable to get it at the correct angle for me .#### #### ####[]
Easy to assembly , has a long cord and the controls are very convenient .#### #### ####[([10], [13], 'POS')]
I had to use a hammer and screwdriver to separate the 2 halves , rendering it unreturnable .#### #### ####[]

I love this lamp , i was suprised at the quality and it actually looks like pictured , it brings a nice festive light to the living room , i wanted to brighten the room and needed something to add so e color , im impressed good quality , took 10 minutes to get it set up , i am thinking about buying a second one , it is a bit shorter than your typical floor lamp but im still happy with it .#### #### ####[]
It was also little difficult to get the lamp positioned .#### #### ####[]
So I guess you need to be an engineer to put this together .#### #### ####[]
I was considering purchasing another of these lamps until the remote issue started happening .#### #### ####[]
Also , I like how it does n't utilize the rotary switch on the lamp , it 's merely a flick on and flick off type of lamp .#### #### ####[]
Can not completely connect two pieces together .#### #### ####[]
First the middle rod and the base rod do not align perfectly , so I was only able to screw it in half way through .#### #### ####[]
Would never purchase again as this is unreliable and cheap !#### #### ####[]
very good quality , heavy base so it stays in place .#### #### ####[]
No clue why it fell apart ( was n't damaged and had been in the same position for 6 months since last move ) .#### #### ####[]
As others have stated , it 's very heavy at the base .#### #### ####[]
I do not want to try a higher watt bulb for fear that it will cause damage .#### #### ####[]
There is a delay between turning it on and it lighting up .#### #### ####[]
It is a harsh light that did n't even last a year .#### #### ####[]
All in all a cheaply made piece of garbage .#### #### ####[]
It is easy to assemble , easy to position for better lighting during online meetings , and easy to adjust brightness .#### #### ####[]
The lamp does not stand straight .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
It has to be plugged in all the time#### #### ####[]

It is well made and easy to assemble .#### #### ####[]
Nice lines from across the room but sitting next to it you get what you pay for with a simple finish and beam detailing , no on/off switch within reach , and visible plastic clips and velcro attachments holding the shade together .#### #### ####[]
It 's not an issue for me because I 've tucked mine away in a corner mostly behind the sofa , but if it 's going to be out in the open , you would definitely notice that the lamp is leaning slightly .#### #### ####[([39], [41, 42], 'NEG')]

it can really light up the room or make it a calmer vibe .#### #### ####[]
You need to pull the cable through the bottom first , not after .#### #### ####[]
I have to prop one leg against the wall for it to stand straight .#### #### ####[]
Also , the cages are completely open so there is nothing diffusing the light , and the bulbs are MASSIVELY bright !#### #### ####[([17], [19, 20], 'POS')]
Which makes it more sturdy so it doesn ’ t tip over .#### #### ####[]
Provides light , falls over , need the right place to attach#### #### ####[]
It looks modern without being stark , provides nice light with the enclosed LED bulb and the marble base makes it sturdy#### #### ####[]
Not only that but it does n't get hot to the touch .#### #### ####[]
The light can be adjusted to any level of brightness , and the adjustable arm holds the light in exactly the position you desire .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS')]
Easy to put together in 30 min or less .#### #### ####[]
The lamp is not sturdy and there were no written directions .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4], 'NEG'), ([1], [8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]
First came in fine , for $ 70 you 'd expect a little higher quality of materials , but it 's not bad .#### #### ####[]
In fact , I seldom have it set on the highest level as it is almost too bright ( love those lumens ) when reading .#### #### ####[]
Picked up to adjust lighting and immediately fell apart .#### #### ####[]
Brightness is only a `` 4 '' because I purchased bulbs separately !#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
Then it started getting super hot all along the pole .#### #### ####[]
Tip : should you purchase this lamp , put together from the bottom upward that wise you ’ ll end up taking it all apart and putting it together again .#### #### ####[]
This floor lamp is entirely too bright .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5, 6], 'NEG')]
Tried to send a video but your video app would n't do it .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
The packages are extremely heavy .#### #### ####[]
We tried adding JB weld to get it to stay up straight .#### #### ####[]
Fixing this required me to disassemble the lamp socket and replace the defective nut with a correct lamp nut .#### #### ####[]
It 's cheaply made , the wood was already falling apart before we even opened the package .#### #### ####[([6], [9, 10], 'NEG')]
Then I put in the batteries and nothing happened !#### #### ####[]
I ’ m suprised how easy this is to assemble .#### #### ####[([9], [5], 'POS')]
Both lamps I purchased had holes drilled in them that were in the wrong place .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
So you 'll have a cord hanging if the lamp is n't right by an outlet .#### #### ####[]
Only thing to watch is when you pick it up to move it the upper section ( that comes off for clamp option ) will come apart - would have been nice if it locked into place .#### #### ####[]
A good reading lamp with easy assembly#### #### ####[]
I used the recommended wattage as well so it was not user error .#### #### ####[]
Also be warned that while the light is n't that bright overall , the out put of each canister is quite bright when directly viewed , so you will need to play with the angles so it looks good .#### #### ####[]
The brightness is perfect for darker corners .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
Works great but wish the magnification was a little higher .#### #### ####[]
I 've placed my cookbooks at the bottom & a few decorative pieces on the top two shelves .#### #### ####[]
I needed an adjustable LED floor lamp for my home office .#### #### ####[]
perfect for my reading corner .#### #### ####[]
It might be an issue if you wanted the canisters to point at different angles .#### #### ####[]
Also , please know that you can only use chandelier base bulbs in this lamp .#### #### ####[]
It easily swings up or away when not needed .#### #### ####[]
This took about 30 minutes to but together probably could have done quicker if I wasn ’ t 9m pregnant huffing and puffing .#### #### ####[]
The second lamp also went dead in about the same time frame .#### #### ####[]
The base was sturdy and I may have kept the lamp if it came with a better lampshade .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]
It 's actually an awkward size : too big to put on a table , and too short to put on the floor .#### #### ####[]
It 's a good quality lamp , but I was surprised to find the cord is not in the ( very thin ) pole like most .#### #### ####[([14], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([5], [3, 4], 'POS')]
Did not come with all assembly pieces .#### #### ####[]
The base is not big enough , so it leans to one side .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5], 'NEG'), ([1], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
I really like the ability to change color/intensity/etc .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [2], 'POS')]
The only drawback for me is the briteness of the bulbs .#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9, 10], [2], 'NEG')]
That can be a bit challenging , but is doable .#### #### ####[]
I bought this for a bedroom because it does n't have any overhead lighting .#### #### ####[]
They have a push button floor control which I keep on my end table for easy access .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [15, 16], 'POS')]
Bought this floor lamp and 1-2 months later had problems turning it on , sometimes it turned off by itself , and the light was always flickering .#### #### ####[([23], [25, 26], 'NEG')]
It 's easy to put together , and from what I can tell , looks relatively sturdy , but we noticed one of the poles would not screw closed correctly , and in fact , looks a little crooked .#### #### ####[([14], [16], 'POS')]
We tried to use this older floor lamp to light our new learning station but it was so painful that several of us ended up with headaches every time .#### #### ####[]
Came with broken screw so can ’ t assemble .#### #### ####[]
I ordered an 8 pack of sz D batteries along with the lamp so I would be able to use the lamp as soon as it arrived without plugging it in .#### #### ####[]
It came with everything I needed and put it together in 15 minutes .#### #### ####[]
Having the wood block on the bottom ties in well with my decor .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS')]
The poll is extremely thin but the base is heavy and will not tip over .#### #### ####[([7], [9], 'POS'), ([1], [4], 'NEG')]
It 's a beautiful piece for your modern living room & affordable too .#### #### ####[]
It works fine , but runs down in a day 's use and then takes a good eight hours to charge again .#### #### ####[]
The bulb seemed like it is supposed to screw into the front but it could not .#### #### ####[]
Notable were the very clear instructions included with the order .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s a little flimsy .. will have to be very careful with it .#### #### ####[]
Looks great in my den#### #### ####[]
Also super tall and sturdy so there ’ s no fear of it tipping .#### #### ####[]

This is NOT a dimmable lamp .#### #### ####[]
We liked this light a lot but it broke after about 1.5 years of use - it stopped adjusting between brightness levels at first .#### #### ####[([3], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG'), ([3], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
Foot switch is a major inconvenience .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [4, 5], 'NEG')]
The cloth of the lamp was wrinkled beyond recognition of the advertised photo .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [6], 'NEG')]
Been wanting one and was able to create a space for it .#### #### ####[]
It was so easy to assemble and my family and I can put whatever we need on the shelves for quick access .#### #### ####[]
Nice decoration but not much light and appear to be factory rejects .#### #### ####[]
Now is it easy to put together ?#### #### ####[]
Missing parts , VERY poor quality wood that easily broke .#### #### ####[]
Super annoying to put together .#### #### ####[]
My anxiousness changed to a disappointment when I finally removed the item from the box and found some scratches and some white paints on the cable .#### #### ####[]
My only complaint would be that the vertical pole is a bit thin to hold the lamp up straight .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
Does a great job of highlighting the art we have in a tricky corner .#### #### ####[([5, 6, 7], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'POS')]
so does n't go everywhere where may be wanted to use .#### #### ####[]
No detailed directions to assemble#### #### ####[]
While trying to assemble the cheap wood cracked down the middle of the leg with minimal hand tightening .#### #### ####[]
The legs are flimsy , the shade Velcro ’ s together and the glue that holds the Velcro isn ’ t strong enough so the Velcro is coming off , the shade doesn ’ t come down far enough to cover the bulb where it screws in .#### #### ####[([13], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'NEG'), ([31], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], 'NEG'), ([25], [27, 28], 'NEG'), ([1], [3], 'NEG')]
Poorly designed , and obviously not tested before being sold .#### #### ####[]
I bought one of these lamps and it did not work .#### #### ####[]
The top pole , where it connects to the angled arm , did not have the right size screw needed for the smaller screw .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
However , it would not have been a problem for me since I planned to use it with the canisters pointing straight up at the ceiling .#### #### ####[]
- They don ’ t make it easy .#### #### ####[]
The only drawback is the light is delayed 3 seconds after turn on .#### #### ####[([5], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
The light works but ca n't do anything cause the remote does n't work .#### #### ####[]

Soon we found that we were trying to study by flashlight as our best option .#### #### ####[]
Lamp came and cord was too long so it could n't be assembled .#### #### ####[([3], [5, 6], 'NEG')]
I love this lamp and it would have gotten five stars , but it was missing a screw , so I had to scrounge for one around the house that would work .#### #### ####[]
It provides MORE than enough LED light and the dimming option works great .#### #### ####[]
They wo n't get detected when trying to re-pair them to the app too .#### #### ####[]
Works just like my other lamps .#### #### ####[]
This lamp is so cool ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Even I could do it !#### #### ####[]
In addition , the stick of this bracket is not the same length .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
It makes your working environment fun !#### #### ####[]
I ’ m disappointed with the quality but it looks nice .#### #### ####[([6], [3], 'NEG')]
Easy to assemble and the brghtness works for me#### #### ####[]
It 's nice too because it keeps the light in a concentrated area , so it would make a good bedside light because you can use it without disturbing others .#### #### ####[]
However after about 3 months , the shades actually dried out and cracked into pieces , creating a fire hazard .#### #### ####[([7], [12, 13, 14], 'NEG'), ([7], [9, 10], 'NEG')]
It also does n't sit well on carpet and instead , leans forward .#### #### ####[]

The lamp looks really nice for the price , but getting it together has been a really stressful experience .#### #### ####[]
In addition , the pucks only have about 15 degrees of horizontal tilt , and the arms are solid tubes , so if you want to adjust the tilt of any of the light pucks , you will need to bend the solid tubes .#### #### ####[]
Other skinny lamps fall over .#### #### ####[]
Fits in my space perfectly#### #### ####[]
It ’ s the perfect reading lamp and so easy to use .#### #### ####[]
Once you do that and you attach it to the base , that part is done .#### #### ####[]
The other adjustment , the swing of the arms , is super easy to adjust once the lamp is assembled and standing .#### #### ####[]
My husband put the lamp together as instructed and its a perfect match for my daughter and new born room .#### #### ####[]
The plastic globes came cracked and broken at the base ! !#### #### ####[]
This is a manufacturers defective fault .#### #### ####[]
Also in the one I received , there were manufacturing problems where the glass in front of the bulb would not stay flush with the canister , and the whole bulb holder was kind of janky .#### #### ####[([13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'NEG')]

Great lamp with easy set up .#### #### ####[]
No matter how hard I tried it is warped .#### #### ####[]
The lamp shade comes rolled up and you have to put it together on the two rods yourself and the edges are fraying , not a good look .#### #### ####[([20], [22], 'NEG')]
The only things to be aware of are that the light pucks only rotate 360 degrees .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]

It looks amazing and was easy to put together but the light is constantly flickering .#### #### ####[([11], [13, 14], 'NEG')]
Missing a shelf with a hole in it to put the light through .#### #### ####[]
My only dislike is the delay of about 5 seconds from the time I flick the switch on the wall to the time it turns on .#### #### ####[]
I assembled the lamp easily ( once I was able to tuck the excess cord in the tubes ) , tried it with the adaptor and it was great .#### #### ####[]

The only negative I have is that the screw holes in the poles were crooked so when you put it together it ’ s not straight .#### #### ####[([8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [14], 'NEG')]
Only the lower light socket works and of course they won ’ t let me send it back I have to bring it someplace or send it UPS ridiculous#### #### ####[]
Only 2 of the 3 pieces attached to each other and there was no way to screw on the 3rd .#### #### ####[]
It was easy to assemble unlike some .#### #### ####[]

Works well but has a flimsy base .#### #### ####[]
Therefore you can not leave this lamp powered on , hook it up to an outlet with a wall-switch , and turn on/off the light from the switch .#### #### ####[]
We have it as a floor lamp partially over the couch/end table .#### #### ####[]
The light worked for 3 seconds before turning off and staying off .#### #### ####[]
I was not bothered by this because i feel it gives it more of the 'stick figure ' look , but i can see some might feel it looks unfinished .#### #### ####[]
The fatal flaw is this lamp must be `` manually '' turned on by touching the power switch because it ( inexplicably ) turns off when the power is cut .#### #### ####[]

Made it 18 months before the base fell apart .#### #### ####[]

Good case but not mag safe .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
It seems sturdy and well made but it is just super slippery .#### #### ####[]

not correct case for iphone 13#### #### ####[]
The turquoise color seems a little darker in person than it did on my screen when I ordered , not enough to bother me .#### #### ####[]
Old one lasted 7years , hope this does#### #### ####[]
But it just does n't fit the phone snug so has a really annoying creaking sound sometimes when holding it .#### #### ####[]

I love the case but and saw reviews about how the bottom start coming apart a little .#### #### ####[]
I had to use a butter to fit into the grooves and pop it apart .#### #### ####[]
There are two seams that wrap around the side of the phone .#### #### ####[]
I do not use the belt clip attachment because of the extra weight and size , but I would if I had to .#### #### ####[]
However , the screen protector/front has bubbles and scratches on it and a sticker on the inside protector left residue .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
Only got this one cause old one did n't fit the new phone .#### #### ####[]
Other reviews have mentioned how the metal ring and mount on the back prevent your phone from laying perfectly flat which is true , but if you are use to using pop sockets with your phones this probably won ’ t bother you at all .#### #### ####[]

After having this case for less than 2 weeks it ’ s already falling off my phone .#### #### ####[]
Fits my iPhone XR great , looks great too !#### #### ####[]
I understand that that crack means it took the shock and my phone did n't , but I wish it had lasted longer .#### #### ####[]

I took the train to visit them and it was easy to get on and off the train as well as in the overhead section .#### #### ####[]
It 's not going to last long so I need to invest in another product .#### #### ####[]
The small one has the let out zipper which I didn ’ t see a lot of when I was looking around .#### #### ####[]
The fabric is very thin .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
While it ’ s sturdy , solid made as far as the compartment goes , the handles are flimsy enough that if you ’ re walking with this behind you and it hits a bump , it sets it on a drunken one wheel course that ’ s like trying to steer a cat .. you finally have to stop and get both wheels on the ground and start again .#### #### ####[([16], [18], 'NEG')]
This one is just too flimsy .#### #### ####[]
Loose loops and some stitches are straight across the bag instead of along the seams .#### #### ####[]
Holding together tho and the zippers work fine !#### #### ####[([5], [6, 7], 'POS')]
It will be perfect for my 10 day trip next summer with lightweight summer clothing .#### #### ####[]
On carpets or anything bumpy , forget about it .#### #### ####[]
Beautiful however , the inside zipper is very clearly put in the wrong way .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]
It is still usable even with the cracks though .#### #### ####[]
The two pieces of baggage that I brought were ALL over the place and I was exhausted when I got to the check in that was at curbside !#### #### ####[]
I like the strap to attach the bag on top of the suitcase .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [1], 'POS')]
This is unacceptable quality but apparently we have no recourse .#### #### ####[]
You could take your batter out quickly without having to pull out all your belongings on the tarmac .#### #### ####[]
The last straw was on a recent local trip because it 's the only time he 'll use this bag now when driving and handling his own bags , was when the lock would not unlock at all , even trying the reset directions online and so we had to cut it open .#### #### ####[([32], [34, 35], 'NEG')]
The large luggage handle broke with the very first time using it !#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
I got myself the green set , and my husband wanted the orange/yellow set ( mustard I think they called it ) .#### #### ####[]
Great product initially , however on our very first trip the lock busted and is hanging off .#### #### ####[([11], [12], 'NEG'), ([11], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
Very small even for a one day trip .#### #### ####[]
The handle of this luggage broke before we could even use it .#### #### ####[]
I learned that the best thing about it is that it 's well balanced when full ( after watching my travel companion 's different-brand bag repeatedly fall over ) .#### #### ####[]
Zipper broke just riding in the car on the way to airport .#### #### ####[([0], [1], 'NEG')]
The black & gray seems a bit higher quality than the all black .#### #### ####[]
Wheels spin well in either direction .#### #### ####[([0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'POS')]
It ’ s a cute set for traveling .#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'POS')]
The suitcase also took a beating , but that I expected going through an airport etc .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
I have n't had the chance to use them on an airplane trip where luggage is abused , so I 'm unsure of just how durable the pieces are .#### #### ####[]
Perfect set of luggage , beautiful color , durable .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([3], [8], 'POS')]
They are a game changer life is much easier with swivel wheels .#### #### ####[]
The magnetic wheels make it so easy to maneuver at the airport .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
A really nice feature is the USB socket on the outside of the suitcase and the internal battery storage compartment .#### #### ####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([16, 17, 18, 19], [2, 3], 'POS')]

First time we used it the wheel broke and the return window was already passed .#### #### ####[]

The smallest one 's zipper broke almost immediately .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
One of the pocket zippers broke upon first use .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]

After packing the luggage into the car and unloading it ( prior to the trip actually being taken ) the other zipper tab had also broken off , making the front pocket completely unusable .#### #### ####[([21, 22], [25, 26], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], [33], 'NEG')]
At first looks great and pretty but you instantly see how cheaply made it is .#### #### ####[([2], [5], 'POS'), ([2], [3], 'POS')]
: ) With only one trip they are so scratched and beat up with only a straight through domestic flight ?#### #### ####[]
I got the luggage out because we are going on a trip and contacted Coollife Luggage and was told they don ’ t sell replacement parts and they couldn ’ t even give me a link as to where to find those wheels !#### #### ####[]
Advertised dimensions include absolute extremities of the case including the soft handles .#### #### ####[]
Also newer models have and upgraded double wheel design ( including stride ) which I hope will resolve the manoeuvrability issues .#### #### ####[]
Also , the white is iridescent ( not white ) so a more feminine color .#### #### ####[([3], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
I was hesitant to buy cause some of the negative reviews about the case completely cracking and breaking .#### #### ####[]

The return time was only 1 month , which I missed , so I now have two bags that I need to keep the handle down on .#### #### ####[]
We went on a roundtrip , and when we picked up our luggage to head home , the zipper compartment on the outside had torn away , resulting in items being lost .#### #### ####[([18, 19, 20, 21, 22], [24, 25], 'NEG')]

Attempted to use this for our first trip and after packing the large suitcase my son tried to pick it up and the fabric tore apart along the side of zipper .#### #### ####[([23], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'NEG')]

This luggage is lovely at first glance , but unfortunately the quality is awful - broke before I even got to use it on a trip .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([11], [13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
2nd time thru airport 2 whells caved in , one of the corners actually cracked the material , very poor construction .#### #### ####[]
You know it 's good , but here is what went wrong :#### #### ####[]
Survived in 2 international trips .#### #### ####[]
- It has the classic compartments I love from samsonite - including 2 well balanced sections split roughly 50/50 : an open section with straps to secure clothes and a fully covered zipped section for items that may need extra security , with organising pockets on the outside of the cover for toiletries and sundries .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [7], 'POS'), ([13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [7], 'POS')]

Beautifully made , durable material and the rolling luggage looks small , but I was able to pack a week 's worth of clothes , including jeans , about 5 dresses , tops , 2 pairs of boots , 2 pairs of shoes , and a bunch of stuff I ca n't remember ( it 's still packed because I do n't feel like taking out all that stuff yet ) .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([4], [3], 'POS')]

Both ended up with the same tear near the zipper during our first trip with them not even a month after purchase .#### #### ####[]
I will put in some towels to wrap my machines in my carry-on luggage just for extra protection .#### #### ####[]
It had been stored in a car , which was garaged at least 95 % of the time and did not encounter extreme temperature conditions .#### #### ####[]
It 's nice that it can also be used as a battery pack for charging your phone .#### #### ####[]
Nice and compact and lightweight though if you need to use as a charger .#### #### ####[]
Jumped it with the battery at 5-6V without an issue .#### #### ####[]
First time I tried to use it , there was no charge .#### #### ####[]
My set up was missing the output adapter#### #### ####[]
I charged it for about 2 hours , then attached it to my Jeep battery .#### #### ####[]
But 8 months in , one of them has already died .#### #### ####[]
I boosted my 5.4 v8 the booster pack was fully charged in the solid green it started the truck easy but you put it back on charge and it will not change back to green it stays on orange#### #### ####[]
And most cell phone chargers that you might have on hand are 2.5 Amp and the directions on the charger says it requires 3.0 Amp charger I think it ’ s pretty cheap of them not to include a charging block so I had to order one separately at another expense .#### #### ####[]
I received the NOCO and made sure to fully charge it .#### #### ####[]
I jump started half a dozen cars , and on weeks long trips I used the Hulkman to keep my phone and iPad topped up when I was 50 miles from the nearest outlet .#### #### ####[]
Sucks did not jump start my car after fully charged and after 2 or 3 tries .#### #### ####[]
I used the air hose to fill an exercise ball and to inflate all 4 tires to 40psi on my 2021 Buick Envision .#### #### ####[]

Bought to keep in my 7.3 diesel 4x4 van but I tried it out on my craftsman overland adventure riding mower .#### #### ####[]
I jumped my truck and I was excited it started my truck .#### #### ####[]
This Thor helped me get through all of my errands today .#### #### ####[]
Did not work 3 months after purchase .#### #### ####[]
Not a chance at cranking over .#### #### ####[]
I barely used it since I purchased on Amazon now it won ’ t turn on .#### #### ####[]
This jumper pack was able to start my truck no problem .#### #### ####[]
Used once , it sat for two months and now it 's dead#### #### ####[]
I later checked instructions to make sure I didn ’ t miss something and the only thing I could have done was to “ override ” the “ safety ” if the unit fails to detect voltage on a completely dead battery but the unit showed the voltage just fine and the battery was not completely dead .#### #### ####[]
Works great out of the box .#### #### ####[]
I have the smaller model and works great just something about this size is no good .#### #### ####[([12], [14, 15], 'NEG')]
immediately it came to life , the alarm began blaring etc .#### #### ####[([7], [9], 'NEG')]
it started my dead cold battery with no troubler , I boughtccccccccccccccccccccccccccc this for my wife so she would not be stranded in some parking lot asking strangers for a jump .#### #### ####[]
Bought this literally two months ago to the day and obviously haven ’ t used it that often charged it once and the charging port is broken already .#### #### ####[([23, 24], [26], 'NEG')]
I can get 2 maybe 3 jumps out of it and then it 's spent and needs a recharge .#### #### ####[]

The first time I ever needed to use it , it stop working and did not have enough juice to charge my car .. what a waste#### #### ####[]
Total jump capacity died pretty quickly on the little 2.4l gas pt engine .#### #### ####[]
In reality it is good for cellphone charge and eventually to crank your car for very limited time .#### #### ####[]
Used on 7.3 gas and 7.3 diesel worked fine on both .#### #### ####[]
My work truck is old and has some issues during the winter , it seems that there is a drain on the battery that during a weekend of sitting around , will drain the battery enough to not be able to start the truck .#### #### ####[]
Cables are too short , wo n't reach .#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
I also liked the bag it comes with to carry the unit and the additional stuff , which are decent .#### #### ####[]
I use this for charging my MacBook , phone and jumping my battery in my truck all the time .#### #### ####[]
It would n't jump start my Ford Explorer with a dead battery .#### #### ####[]
It starts up my car right away .#### #### ####[]
It simply wont kick start anything#### #### ####[]
Trying to charge it via the USB is pointless , it took 6+ hours to get it to 2 blue lights ( and one was flickering ) .#### #### ####[]
Pack a lot of power for multiple jump starts#### #### ####[]
There is an override mode that can be used to jump start vehicles with completely dead batteries , in that mode the safety features are disabled .#### #### ####[([22, 23], [25], 'NEG')]
-No case which is a major negative for me .#### #### ####[]
Bought this power pack and it sure packs a punch .Easy to use just connect to terminals and starrt .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
The AC adapter is not included , so most people will need to purchase that additional device to make this work .#### #### ####[]
You connect jumper attachment and it blinks red an green .#### #### ####[]
I love that there is no wires .#### #### ####[]
It will boost a car , but usually it pulses off the computer at least once during the attempt .#### #### ####[]
Great power convenient carry case more power then u will need a must have in the vehicle#### #### ####[]
stays charged for longer life and jumps a car with ease#### #### ####[]
The design of the battery pack is actually nicer than my old one , with a real rugged look to it .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [8], 'POS')]
It Will charge up completely from one bar in 15 minutes when plugged into the cigarette lighter ( this is WAY TOO QUICK ) or a usb charger in the wall .#### #### ####[]
Long lasting battery as well.Definitely 5 stars .#### #### ####[]
I couldn ’ t start the car on the road in the cold winter .#### #### ####[]
Almost useless for 6 cyl gas engine of KIA SORENTO .#### #### ####[]
I watch some folks online trying to use this thing and they just blunder through the entire process by trial and error .#### #### ####[]
When I needed it 4 Mos later in May the charge was at half .#### #### ####[]
I do n't believe it stated that the charger was not included .#### #### ####[]
Needed it 2 weeks after full charge and it was dead .#### #### ####[]
I re set it and the light stays off untill I jump the vehicle again then check engine lite comes back on#### #### ####[]
Yea the price it a little high but for what this thing can do is well worth it , it ’ s basically like an AED it walks you through the steps .#### #### ####[]
As other reviewers have said , it worked great-once .#### #### ####[]
I tried four other portable jump starters and this was the only one with enough power to start my SUV on the first try .#### #### ####[]
Buy something else .. never worked one time trying to jump a vehicle .#### #### ####[]

Always works well favorite process is setting the desired air pressure and it will shut off automatically .#### #### ####[]
Charges 1 cellphone 1 time before it depleats the battery nearly 2/3 ... Ok cool it has an a/c outlet ... Big deal if it 's always dead .... Takes a whole day to charge and goes dead in minutes .#### #### ####[]
It cranks once then goes dead .#### #### ####[]
Used it one time now it do n't work#### #### ####[]
Even with the indicator showing that the NOCO Boost Plus was fully charged , I was unable to jump start a 2016 Honda Odyssey , 2017 Honda CRV and a 2017 3.6 L Cadillac CTS , yet I was able to jump start them from a nearby car .#### #### ####[]
It seems built well , the only suggestions I have for it would be to make the AWG bigger for the jump starter cables , and to connect both sides of the alligator clamps to the cables ( only half of the alligator clips are connected to the battery cables ) .#### #### ####[]
Even with a brand new boat battery , I ’ ve never seen the engine turn over that fast ( 351w ) sincerely impressed !#### #### ####[]
The booster is small and lightweight .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5], 'POS')]
Easy to use , easy to charge , reliable , and holds up for multiple jumps on a single charge .#### #### ####[]
It has to be home plugged in to the wall permanently if you ever want to use it .#### #### ####[]
When the battery gets down to 85 % it wo n't work ! !#### #### ####[]
It won ’ t charge it just keeps saying low battery#### #### ####[]
The power output of this product is pretty good but if you do n't get it to start the first time your not going to get a second chance , the battery life is not good at all tried three different occasions to start a 88 Ford ranger with the 2.9 l and it attempted to start for a few seconds and then the battery went dead on the jump starter .#### #### ####[([31, 32], [34, 35], 'NEG'), ([1, 2], [8], 'POS')]
This is not a charger it is a quick start so after you disconnect it you have to let your car run or drive it for at least 10 minutes to charge the battery .#### #### ####[]
Just push the connect button , and away it went .#### #### ####[]
Need to have battery in front of you to use this .#### #### ####[]
I called Triple A and Triple A jump started the car with no problem using a much more powerful NOCO charger .#### #### ####[]
So far , I have used it once to top off my tires by a few PSIs and jumped a friend 's car one time .#### #### ####[]
Of course , I could n't start the car .#### #### ####[]
It was able to crank 3 times for very short and after a 10 min rest -1 more times .#### #### ####[]
Within minutes , the air compressor motor started pouring out white smoke .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]

Works great and battery seems to last forever .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7], 'POS')]
These are excellent for getting the job done , dead battery no problem .....#### #### ####[]
When I need to use it , the ready light does n't come on and it wo n't work unless that 's on .#### #### ####[]
It 's tiny and convenient but not powerful .#### #### ####[]
The best jumpstarter ever , it start my car right away when others didn ’ t .#### #### ####[]
There is no safety feature that cuts it off be cause that thing kept burning .#### #### ####[]
Living in Arizona , we have come to understand that the intense heat is hard on car batteries .#### #### ####[]
There are no capacitors inside like some of you might be thinking .#### #### ####[]
Very easy to use , just connect , my car started again .#### #### ####[]
Ridiculously written instructions say that means short circuit .#### #### ####[]
Failed to jump start my 4 cylinder car and the device was fully charged#### #### ####[]
Garbage don ’ t turn off and just pos#### #### ####[]
I 'm disappointed that I 've had to call for roadside assistance in each instance of needing a jump start .#### #### ####[]
Given all the Glowing reviews , here 's one that 's neutral at best : The product did n't work for me .#### #### ####[]
This product starts our battery every time .#### #### ####[]
This may however be fault of the cold weather and/or the tire sensors themselves although the car is brand new woth less than 2k miles on it .#### #### ####[]
Admittedly there is a cigarette lighter charger , which has a female USB C end , but again you can only slow charge it with the supplied USB A to USB C cable .#### #### ####[]
Easy to use and charge fast it 's worth the money .#### #### ####[]
Within 10 seconds my Jeep was running again , I disconnected the charger and let the Jeep run for about 10 minutes and the battery is fine now .#### #### ####[]
The only thing I find it works well for is running LED lights in a tent .. that does n't last long either .#### #### ####[]
The product can not be recharged .#### #### ####[]
I then hooked up my daughter 's vintage Stark Power jump starter , and my Explorer fired up instantly .#### #### ####[]
It did the job but ran its battery down too fast in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
Tried it again on the mower after recharging , same outcome .#### #### ####[]
This unit fired it right up so I could get to the parts store and get a new battery .#### #### ####[]
This thing fried and I never got to use it .#### #### ####[]
Got this for my daughter so she would n't get stuck with a van that would n't start , here in the subzero temps of Minnesota .#### #### ####[]
After one use the battery would n't charge .#### #### ####[]
Smaller than expected which means it takes up less space !#### #### ####[]
Similar to the first one I had , this one comes with a nice hard case and the jumpstart cables .#### #### ####[]
Haven ’ t had a need to jump start a vehicle but firmly believe it ’ s good to have and not immediately need it than to need it and not have it .#### #### ####[]
My one big problem with this item is it gives you the USB cable but does not give you a charging block .#### #### ####[]
The car roared to life .#### #### ####[]
The gooloo was a complete failure as it instantly goes into a protect mode that shuts the unit down until it ’ s plugged in to charge again .#### #### ####[]
I live in a country with bitterly cold winter temperatures that drop to -40F and stubbornly stay there for several weeks .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't say whether or not this product will work for a good battery which happened to be drained , but it did not work for me .#### #### ####[]
It has a charge standby of 18 months so charge it and pack it in you car and bring it in for a charge every now and then , plus it has enough power to turn over a 10 L engine .#### #### ####[]
Came in handy to jump snowmobiles in negative 24 degree weather .#### #### ####[]
The light was white that indicates that the unit is ready and when I tried ignition the engine just clicked .#### #### ####[]

I love it but the where the metal is to grasp the terminal on the battery the plastic sticks out too much.it ’ s hard for it to clamp on.out of the few times I had to jump the car it wouldn ’ t jump it once and I had to flag someone down#### #### ####[]
I thought this product would be great on my 7.3l diesel since its rated for up to 12l .#### #### ####[]

First , it is relatively light and everything fits easily into the carry case .#### #### ####[]
First time I use it was on my toyota 4runner with a dead battery .#### #### ####[]

They describe this as `` up to 10 charges '' but for a diesel truck it 's only good for one jump , and a regular car it 's only good for 2 jumps before it needs to be charged .#### #### ####[]

This is the number 4 jump I did buy the 2 first one was great but the last 2 seems not to hold the power , after I use couple times I need to charge again#### #### ####[]

Compact great design and holds a charge for a long time#### #### ####[]
Another jump start battery worked after this one failed , so I 'm confident that the problem is in this unit .#### #### ####[]
I saw a different brand of battery jump packs that have the same amount of power and they did include everything you need to charge there item .#### #### ####[]
It worked great when it worked ( actual output was about 17 volts ) , but it may not have the Noco quality that you ’ re expecting .#### #### ####[]

This is a completely useless jumper as all it can do is charge your phone - NOT jump start your car no matter how tiny the engine is .#### #### ####[]
I check the button on this jumper and sure it showed 4 blue lights indicating of a full charged .#### #### ####[]

But yesterday when I tried to jump start my Honda Civic , it did not work .#### #### ####[]
There must be some magic here , to get all that power in such a small box .#### #### ####[]
When I bought this jump box I was most worried that it would have to sit and charge my battery or would n't work at all , but it only takes the amount of time to open the hood and hook up the cables .#### #### ####[]
Luckily , my friend had jumper cables and the vehicle started up right away .#### #### ####[]
Latched it on and plugged into the battery , and it started , but it started quickly .#### #### ####[]
My best guess is that the battery voltage was so low that this did not even recognize that it was connected to a battery .#### #### ####[]
I tried to recharge it , it took 8 hours and did not charge .#### #### ####[]
It worked so well we bought one as a gift for our parents .#### #### ####[]

You can get two jump starts or charge an iPhone once , bottom line , waste of money .#### #### ####[]
It barley rolls over my 6.0 L engine when needed and will not roll over my side by side engine fast enough to start it .#### #### ####[]

very bad quality , it fried during jumping the truck#### #### ####[]
It holds a charge reliably and it has the power to jump start a car a few times without needing to be recharges .#### #### ####[]

Used it lightly for few times .. last time I used it , I cranked the car and noticed that the car started wanting to stall up and down .. after noticing something wrong I jumped and took the jump starter off but noticed that the voltage was a bit over 16 .. the car computer got damaged and never wanted to start any more ..#### #### ####[]
It ’ s light weight , small size , and enough cranking power to jump start both V-8 and Diesel engines is definitely the biggest plus .#### #### ####[]
Eventually had to call AAA and local tow truck arrived , the mechanic had this device .#### #### ####[]
My son 's battery died so we tried the unit .#### #### ####[]
Not strong enough to start a 2010 X5 Diesel .#### #### ####[]
It 's way easier to connect a jump starter than trying to get another vehicle close enough to hook up jumper cables .#### #### ####[]
Few weeks after I had the same issue with my other car and neither of my two GOOLOO jump starters worked .#### #### ####[]
The lights and fuel pump came on and then the car battery jump died .#### #### ####[]
I received a jumper cable with a faulty LED .#### #### ####[]
The purpose of the product is to jump start your car when in need and I HAD TO PAY 20 for someone to jump start me .#### #### ####[]
Right out of the box Did not work !#### #### ####[]
Don ’ t like that it only starts a v8 twice .#### #### ####[]
This GB50 has left me stranded more than once .#### #### ####[]
It doesn ’ t actually jump anything off and I ’ ve never been successful with having this jump box to work .#### #### ####[]
Also it has compressor build in , alternator check on little less price than GOOLOO but it is very bulky , which was the reason to buy GOOLOO after reading one comparison test online with very good test result for the price of $ 69 .#### #### ####[]
This is easy to use .#### #### ####[]
The charger then showed 77 but the car would n't crank .#### #### ####[]
It took about 20 minutes to charge the jumper battery up to full 16.4v and 4 lights again .#### #### ####[]
Used for he first time and caught on fire today .#### #### ####[]
I still have the jump starter and will read over 16 volts when hooked up to any battery ..#### #### ####[]
I tried unsuccessfully to jump start the car with a neighbor and cables .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't plug stuff into it and use it as a power source for other things .#### #### ####[]
I 've bought and used six of these jump starters for myself or as gifts , and FOUR of them have failed either shortly after purchase or shortly after the one year warranty expired .#### #### ####[]
It will not be a long term solution for running a btc antminer as a battery backup if power goes out but for a car starter it.works .#### #### ####[]
It does not work , we tried it on several batteries .#### #### ####[]
It wo n't hold a charge for a week ?#### #### ####[]
So I hooked up the jumper again and it worked the 2nd time too .#### #### ####[]
I can confirm this will start a 3.6L V6 Chevy engine with a completely dead battery .#### #### ####[]
it is good for jump bigger and small cars#### #### ####[]
You do n't even need a battery in the car to start it .#### #### ####[]
It is easier to haul this small NOCO Jumper around than my larger DieHard Battery Jumper which weighs about 25 pounds .#### #### ####[]
I have owned this one for about 7 months and it will not jump start anything any longer .#### #### ####[]
The product looks great and well built.Battery drained very quickly and I am surprised it could charge multiple cars per charge as advertised .#### #### ####[]
Well packaged , but type face in instruction book is quite small and for many not easily read .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [11], 'NEG'), ([4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]

My plan was to just throw it in the car so I always had it when I need it .#### #### ####[]
It turned over my dulley#### #### ####[]
Really cheap product , got broken after 5 min#### #### ####[]
It is good for multiple jumps .#### #### ####[]
The SUV started without a hitch , hopefully it will give me many more years of use .#### #### ####[]
It comes with a neat carrying case#### #### ####[([5, 6], [4], 'POS')]
It can save you or someone you meet from being stranded .#### #### ####[]

Now when I get to use it or charge it , I get error code 3 which says the ambient temperature is either two low or two high which it is NOT .#### #### ####[]
I tried switching on the light .. battery drained very quickly .#### #### ####[([7], [8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]
Everything else worked on it but it would not jump my truck off .#### #### ####[]

I ignored it and charge the jumper till it showed 4 lights .#### #### ####[]
I took used it on my 2006 Pontiac G6 and it did n't work .#### #### ####[]
This unit has reverse polarity and spark protection circuits that are enabled in the normal mode where the battery voltage of the vehicle you are jump-starting is greater than 3 volts .#### #### ####[]
I have used this 3 times now and works great the only issue I have with it is every time I jump my vehicle with this product it kicks on my check engine light .#### #### ####[]
Had him pop the hood and she hooked up the little jumper .#### #### ####[]
It was 100 % charged as it indicated , but it couldn ’ t power the electronics .#### #### ####[]
I 've never had it go dead on me and fail to work .#### #### ####[]
Portable and easy to store .#### #### ####[]
Our car 's ignition has a tendency to get stuck in a way that can drain the battery so I got this when we got stuck in the city .#### #### ####[]
I followed the instructions correctly .#### #### ####[]
Also the cords to attach with are very short .#### #### ####[([2], [8], 'NEG')]
I have a Buick Enclave , those familiar will know the battery is fairly hard to get to under the back seats in a floor compartment , relay terminals are under hood in classic location .#### #### ####[]
wo n't jump start cars and currently serve as an iphone charger .#### #### ####[]
This was at 30 * F. I ’ m confident the truck would have started on a warmer day .#### #### ####[]
As soon as I opened it , I love the lightness .#### #### ####[([10], [8], 'POS')]
It is also very portable .#### #### ####[]
But with a truly DEAD battery , there may be insufficient charge , and then the Jump Pack wo n't detect and wo n't function unless you press the Boost or Manual Override button .#### #### ####[]
Very easy to use and something everyone should have !#### #### ####[]
As long as you can accept that everything else works perfectly .#### #### ####[]
I assumed user error or a faulty connection the first 2 times until the GB40 was used and started the vehicle .#### #### ####[]
But the capacity and total amounts of jump starts per full charge is not accurate .. at least with mine ..#### #### ####[([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [13, 14], 'NEG')]

Inflated tires up to 60 psi so far with no issues and highly accurate .#### #### ####[]

The only issue I have is that although the product claims to shut off when the desired air pressure is met , it does n't seem to tell you in any way when it has as it does n't power down or change behaviour at all leaving me frantically turning it off manually to prevent overinflation .#### #### ####[]

For those who want extra features , such as a flashlight , USB ports to charge a phone and so on , take a look at a jump starter with a ( lithium ) battery .#### #### ####[]
GMC Terrain would not start so I used the NEXPOW Jump Start and all it did was turn the engine over once and that 's it .#### #### ####[]
Took a road trip with a questionable battery .#### #### ####[]
When I connected the unit to the car battery , the unit kept emitting a continuous sound and did not jump the car to start .#### #### ####[]
For reference , I still use my original Noco GB150 that I bought 4 years ago , and it still works almost as good as when it was new .#### #### ####[]
My plan was to use it to charge my devices periodically .#### #### ####[]
This somehow reversed the polarity on my battery and now I have a short in my system .#### #### ####[]
Ordered the next size up to see if it will work as good as the smaller size does .#### #### ####[]
Haven ’ t had it long enough to use it on a car , but it worked great to get 12v lawn tractor going , plus saved the hassle of pushing the tractor 30 ’ -40 ’ , then jump-starting , using our F150 .#### #### ####[]
Wont jump start if car battery is dead .#### #### ####[]
With a full charge , it will only charge my phone about 60 % before it is out of power .#### #### ####[]
This really worked well & was easy to use .#### #### ####[]
To use the buttons , you must long-press them for 1-2 seconds .#### #### ####[]
I did try starting a car with no battery , with no avail .. some people claimed they drove a car from A to B using the jump starter .#### #### ####[]
would definitely reccommend this product.It also stays charged .#### #### ####[]
Used it three times and stopped working#### #### ####[]
Bought this literally two months ago to the day and obviously haven ’ t used it that often charged it once and the charging port is broken already .#### #### ####[([23, 24], [26], 'NEG')]
It 's one or the other , almost like they are designed to fail after the warranty and sometimes they fail immediately .#### #### ####[]
Need to have battery in front of you to use this .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately for me it was unable to jump my battery .#### #### ####[]
Another jump start battery worked after this one failed , so I 'm confident that the problem is in this unit .#### #### ####[]
Purchased this a while back , it dod not work out of the box so i contacted support which wslked me through all the steps in the manual which i had already done but never worked - typical support which assumes user error rather than offer solutions to actually fix problem or facilitate a return .#### #### ####[]
This thing starts my car better that the original battery !#### #### ####[]
Then the very next day I was going to try using it for to charge my phone and battery was dead .#### #### ####[]
It won ’ t hold a charge either .#### #### ####[]
I went to pump up a tire the hose in the inside came lose my r the compressor broke a seal .#### #### ####[]
Yes , these are 4 times cranking for about 2-3 sec each and had to recharge it .#### #### ####[]
It is too big and heavy .#### #### ####[]
It will jump start my truck when the batteries ( 2 ) are dead .#### #### ####[]
I bought a NOCOC Boost GB50 and kept it in my truck , out of the weather .#### #### ####[]
I purchased this jumper for my boat , and of course the first day I got it , took it out to the lake and the boat is nearly dead .#### #### ####[]

My friend brought over his HALO Jump Start and it cranked right up .#### #### ####[]
I ’ ve had this product for at least two weeks and at first the battery life was amazing and it lasted often on for as far as this but right now I am having one hell of you trying to charge it it won ’ t hold a charge after the initial charge that it came with#### #### ####[([15, 16], [18], 'POS')]
I was not able to plug this into a computer or any adapter and get it to charge .#### #### ####[]
Jump started my boat , golf cart and a friend 's car battery all in a day .#### #### ####[]
You have to recharge it after each use .#### #### ####[]
But for the outrageous price and lackluster battery capacity .#### #### ####[]
Key feature of this product is the ability to fast charge via USB C. Why then do they only supply a USBA to USBC cable , which is not capable of FAST charging .#### #### ####[]
The charger worked well the first time but stopped working the second time I used it .#### #### ####[([1], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
The battery would drain on me when key in the ignition would be left turned all the way back .#### #### ####[]
Used this to jump start my dead battery .#### #### ####[]
I now have this with me whenever I 'm away from home , it 's heavy but small enough to take with me .#### #### ####[]
Used to jump our vehicle battery several times with no problem#### #### ####[]
Simple and easy to use and it fits in the glove compartment .#### #### ####[]
I put a battery charger on it , but it flashed an error after a while .#### #### ####[]

I jumped my friends mini that has been stuck here for many months now and it did n't have an issue with that car .#### #### ####[]
Everybody was so impressed that such a small item had such a great kick .#### #### ####[]
On multiple occasions with a completely dead battery , the pack needs to be activated in “ override ” mode because it doesn ’ t recognize the dead battery .#### #### ####[]
This product is pretty amazing and works great .#### #### ####[]
left it on just a low tire and waited 15 mins and only raised it 2 psi !#### #### ####[]
I charged it per instructions BUT it did n't have sufficient energy to start my car .#### #### ####[]
Not sure how warmth plays a part but used once for air so but feels sturdy#### #### ####[]
The product never turned on .#### #### ####[]
Typically , I attach the cables to the battery and power up the unit , activate boost because the battery is always completely dead ( car sits in the back unused ) and then put my keys into the ignition and it starts up immediately with ease#### #### ####[]
But here we are 6 months down the line and tried to use it and it is DEAD and WILL NOT CHARGE .#### #### ####[]
It really really works very well .#### #### ####[]
Unit is very light in weight compared to the other chargers .#### #### ####[([0], [3, 4, 5], 'POS')]
To be of any use , you have to carry it with you .#### #### ####[]

Instead of waiting there helplessly for help , I hooked up the jump starter and was out of there in less than 5 minutes .#### #### ####[]
So the jumper works well .. and MAY hold a charge for 6-8 months for a reliable emergency jumper ...#### #### ####[]

I have a 2017 Sprinter with a 6.0L engine and the 10.0 jump starter will not start my diesel engine in zubzero weather .#### #### ####[]

It seems it is built to withstand a bomb blast .#### #### ####[]
I received then item with all the screws missing showing it clearly was tampered with and won ’ t charge or turn on .#### #### ####[]
The cables were short for my needs .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG')]
Every car owner should have one of these in the car , so much easier that trying to place cars together for a jump .#### #### ####[]
Also - I bought it because it has a high PSI rating - that 's kind of funny - because I attempted to pump up my truck tire ( 33 '' x12.5 '' ) and the battery went from 100 % down to 50 % within 8-10 minutes , and after 15-20 minutes , the unit died - it never finished pumping up the tire .#### #### ####[]
The safety mode will trip before the engine will turn over .#### #### ####[]
So , I ca n't attest to how well it will jump start a battery that is completely drained .#### #### ####[]
This is exactly the same as the other GT1500 just this one is green .#### #### ####[]
It was NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH to jump start my Subaru Crosstrek .#### #### ####[]
1st unit was DOA , same issue as other reported , it will not charge .#### #### ####[]

Worked right out of the box with easy instructions .#### #### ####[]
Won ’ t start 6.0 diesel even fully charged#### #### ####[]

I bought this higher capacity model for extra piece of mind with my 2019 Lincoln Navigator .#### #### ####[]
A lot quicker and more convenient than jump starting from other vehicles .#### #### ####[]
If the car battery does not have enough juice , it would not charge this thing to the state which will boot start the car .#### #### ####[]
It does however work as a flashlight so on the plus side you ’ ll have that as you sit in your car freezing because you put your faith in a cheap jumpstarter .#### #### ####[]
The pro is that the device works and is convenient when you need a jump .#### #### ####[([5], [9], 'POS')]
I took the gadget out , hooked in the jumper cable extension , hooked it to his battery , and told him it should be ready in 10 seconds and we waited .#### #### ####[]
When I checked the display on the jump starter , it indicated that it was still 96 % charged , heh .#### #### ####[]
I 've had this for a while and have regularly used it to power 12V accessories in my car and charge my cellphone .#### #### ####[]
I gave it 2 stars because I went to recharge it for my wife and it wo n't hold a charge .#### #### ####[]
I purchased this to use as a backup to my large jump box , however , the compact size and the ability to jump start most pieces of equipment , I tend to bypass carrying my heavy box and counting me favorite jump starter .#### #### ####[]

Got this product for my husband and it was working great but the jump function quit working and is only a battery back up now .#### #### ####[]
I put this autogen on and left it for a couple minutes .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s everything it was described as except it wouldn ’ t jumpstart my Honda Civic ( 1.3L engine that required 350cca ) , but it couldn ’ t fir some reason .#### #### ####[]
Contents of the box includes the regular jumper cable , charger , instruction booklet and cigarette plug , charging cable .#### #### ####[]
If that makes the car not start it will time out and the cables have to be fully unplugged and plugged back in to try again .#### #### ####[]
Only got about 7 months and maybe 10-12 jumps out of this thing before it is now basically rendered useless .#### #### ####[]

I was truly amazed at how well it worked , even better than my shop charger .#### #### ####[]
The jump starter works well no doubt .#### #### ####[]
No discharge issues or un wanted voltage spikes .#### #### ####[]
It would not allow me to charge it .#### #### ####[]
Dont know if its just to small or does not pack enough charge but can not get it to work for my car , which falls in the specs of this device .#### #### ####[]
But then when I check the charge again it only indicated 1 blue light .#### #### ####[]
Works great and easy to use !#### #### ####[]
It wouldn ’ t start a full size V8 6.2 L gas engine , which is expected , and I don ’ t consider that to be a fault .#### #### ####[]
It has started a completely dead battery using the special button more than three times and saved the day.I have used it about 10 times on different vehicles and only charged it once because it was about at a halfway charge .#### #### ####[]
I 've used it about 5-6 times and have n't needed to recharge yet too !#### #### ####[]
My only issue is it does not hold a charge very long , but that is an issue with all lithium batteries I have read .#### #### ####[]

Actually thinking about it , this device is smaller than a decent set of jump leads .#### #### ####[([6], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
Years ago we were always warned to carry jumper cables in the trunk .#### #### ####[]
I 've only used it a few times so far but it 's started every vehicle with ease and the battery level has n't even dropped at all yet .#### #### ####[([20, 21], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'POS')]
I have a few smaller units that were a lot cheaper , but actually end up working better .#### #### ####[]
This jump starter really works .#### #### ####[]
Easy to use and long battery life#### #### ####[]
No charger adapter to connect to the wall or car outlets and no information about the needed adapter#### #### ####[]
Never received the item ( jumper cables ) and the grabber was defective#### #### ####[]
It is an excellent unit and I would have given it five stars , but the charging cord came without the adapter that allows you to plug it into the wall .#### #### ####[]
Starts cars to small equipment .#### #### ####[]
One charge and many uses ! !#### #### ####[]
I ordered and received this product , and I like it and is very nice because is light weight and small size and very easy to handle it and keep it in the car all time and very useful in the time that needed and can be recharged in home or in the car and have LED light just in case and can be used to charge mobile phone also , very handy and useful in the case of flat tire or if jump needed and also nice to have it on camping .#### #### ####[]
However it ’ s side features , charging iPhone , etc have proven great to have .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [13], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [13], 'POS')]
This AVAPOW looks good enough and full feature and lots of capacity and decent price , but they do n't address this issue at all , and I 'm not willing to roll the dice that it may or may not work on a battery after leaving the headlights on for a week at the airport .#### #### ####[]
I also used it to start an 8000 watt generator that had no battery .#### #### ####[]
Premium price for the product when you can buy a less expensive booster for around $ 100 , but NOCO still can ’ t supply the cable to charge the device .#### #### ####[]
But it was able to do everything else but what I needed it for#### #### ####[]
in all it did not work .#### #### ####[]
My vehicle has a 2.5 liter engine and 12 volt battery .#### #### ####[]
I went to use the compressor the first time and the connection piece had been cut off .#### #### ####[([11, 12], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
The product was loud but that is expected .#### #### ####[]
I had to call AAA to get it started .#### #### ####[]
Love it- it will just a diesel with both dead batteries#### #### ####[]
Love it , compact and simple to use#### #### ####[]
It shows it 's charged but will not start a car#### #### ####[]
Not suitable for a truck ever .#### #### ####[]
Does n't matter if you try to hold the button in for a few seconds , keeping the clamps on the poles as sturdy as possible , does n't matter if you start the thing before OR after attaching it to the poles etc .#### #### ####[]
Same price and not much more power .#### #### ####[]
The battery life is good enough .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4, 5], 'POS')]
I did my usual but the light bar was not chasing , I tried activating the boost function but it would n't activate .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [9, 10], 'NEG')]
Not only that i was able to help at least 10 people with their jumping needs and i dont have to pull long cables , car alignments instead just take out Autogen and problem solved .#### #### ####[]
I expect it to work perfectly and be easy to use .#### #### ####[]
The device completely drained its charge in less than 10 seconds .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]
It has many zippered compartments to keep the attachments separate .#### #### ####[]
With this kind of device that you only need in emergencies , you really want a case to hold the battery pack and the clamps together so things stay tidy and neat in your glove compartment or toolbag .#### #### ####[]
Well , it works and that 's what 's important .#### #### ####[]
left it plugged in for 24hrs and it only charged to 16 %#### #### ####[]
This POS will not jump a car if battery is dead .#### #### ####[]
I bought a similar item about a year ago that worked great when my Honda Odyssey died , so I figured I 'd get a second one for my other car .#### #### ####[]
Expecting the same result I turned the key and the engine cranked for a good 8 seconds before hitting a protect mode on the clamps .#### #### ####[]
Charged the device as directed .#### #### ####[]
Couldn ’ t get another car pulled up close enough in the garage to jump start the wife ’ s car .#### #### ####[]
Straight out of the box like many other users it would n't hold a charge .#### #### ####[]
We used it for our tractor , it starts right up#### #### ####[]
Worked great until just recently .#### #### ####[]
Not sure how long it will hold a charge for , but after starting my car twice and lying in the car for 2 weeks , it still shows 100 % .#### #### ####[]
Compact but a nice little unit for jumpstarting .#### #### ####[]
This product sucks , do n't ever buy , randomly stops charging when I even took good care of it , save your money and buy another brand#### #### ####[]
It stop working after I jump couple cars with#### #### ####[]
Only about 25 % was lost between jumping the car twice and charging my phone once .#### #### ####[]
The air pump works well for what I needed .#### #### ####[]
Aside from the backorder issue and the first one being faulty , it is a solid product .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , it is hard to determine which packs Do offer the Boost button .#### #### ####[]
I used this to start my riding lawnmower .#### #### ####[]
It will jump just about anything - if it does n't then there is most likely something going on with the vehicle itself .#### #### ####[]
Hope you only need it once , after that , will not recharge ....#### #### ####[]
It didn ’ t start my car… it ’ s easy to use but didn ’ t work…just sitting in my kitchen drawer .#### #### ####[]
I think the stated 21800MHA capacity may not be true .#### #### ####[]
That said , I was unable to get all 4 tires to read 40psi , with fluctuations frpm the tire sensors ranging from 38-41psi after use .#### #### ####[]
This item doesn ’ t charge back up ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Charge indicator shows power level .#### #### ####[]
Peace of junk , do n't waste your money with this item , does n't every jump a small car .#### #### ####[]
However after owing for 22 months I checked the charge level and found it to be completely dead .#### #### ####[]
One time use than you need to charge it .#### #### ####[]
I needed to get this tire to about 65PSI - it never made it .#### #### ####[]
Had to jump start a Honda Accord today .#### #### ####[]
Constant red light and beep ?#### #### ####[]
I even left it attached to the battery 30 minutes , still nothing .#### #### ####[]
It will not hold a charge .#### #### ####[]
I have charged it twice now .#### #### ####[]
And now it wo n't even take a charge .#### #### ####[]
I only used it like 3 times and now it wo n't charge anymore#### #### ####[]
They are actually very warm .#### #### ####[]
I wore in 22 * F with the first snow since I have purchased .#### #### ####[]
But within less than a month of owning them , the rubber has become separated from the bottom of the shoe right where the arch is on the left shoe .#### #### ####[]

It was very uncomfortable and my foot is swollen and hurting so much because of these bad quality heavy shoes#### #### ####[([19], [3], 'NEG'), ([19], [16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
I know leather stretches , but I do n't think that 's enough for them to be comfortable .#### #### ####[]
The only downside to these is they are extremely loud , the heels are hollow and the shoes themselves are very squeaky .#### #### ####[([12], [14], 'NEG'), ([17], [21], 'NEG')]
Inside lining -- or lack thereof -- means you feel the heel bolt in the bottom of your foot .#### #### ####[]
Comfy and keep my feet dry .#### #### ####[]
Too small size an half#### #### ####[]
I need an arch support but this felt as if there was a golf ball under my arch .#### #### ####[]
I am totally going to buy a pair in a fun color some time in the future !#### #### ####[]
They wipe off easily when they get dirty , and they are very comfortable , even on longer walks and long days on your feet .#### #### ####[]
Other than this , they are cute boots .#### #### ####[([7], [6], 'POS')]
My foot is hurting so bad so i sent company a message and they started interrogating me asking for pictures .#### #### ####[]
I had them on for less than 5 min and my feet were red .#### #### ####[]
First pair was a little large traded in for half a size smaller .#### #### ####[]
I was skeptical after reading some reviews , but they arrived in perfect condition and fit more comfortable than most more expensive brands ( not as tight ) love them !#### #### ####[]
They appear sturdy and well made .#### #### ####[]
These felt really tight on my feet and the inside sole is bumpy and weird .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [14], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [12], 'NEG')]
No support at all and she nearly rolled her ankle plus the inside foot bed come out every time she takes her foot out !#### #### ####[([12, 13, 14], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
They are so comfortable and cute .#### #### ####[]
These shoes work in that respect .#### #### ####[]
I have a bad back and I can still wear these everyday if I wanted to .#### #### ####[]
Immediately out the packaging , turned the boots bottom side up and can clearly see spots and reason rubs .#### #### ####[]
little weried in the toe aera but they cute and look ok#### #### ####[]
They are a pointed toe so some people may want to go up a size .#### #### ####[]
Fit is nice , and I have wide feet with bunions .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS')]
Great boots , order one size smaller than you regularly wear and they are perfect .#### #### ####[]

Don ’ t even know if they would fit or not .#### #### ####[]
Going to look great with my Halloween costume .#### #### ####[]
I wear a size 8 and had to return the 8 in the mini to a 7 and they 're still too big !#### #### ####[]
My husband ordered these for me in a size 7 since people said they 're true to size .#### #### ####[]
Horrible zipper broke first time pulling them up#### #### ####[([0, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

I have been unable to wear heels for quite a while due to balance issues .#### #### ####[]
The fit was wonderful for my wide feet ( 9c ) , but after standing and walking around I kinda felt my feet cramp , fall asleep !#### #### ####[]
Very comfy and good quality would buy again#### #### ####[]
They might stretch the more I wear them , but I definitely wish I 'd ordered a size up .#### #### ####[]
The boots themselves are comfortable and stylish , even being a great knock off for a pair of Tom wedges .#### #### ####[([1], [6], 'POS'), ([1], [4], 'POS')]
Absolutely NOT water proof AT ALL .#### #### ####[]
They didn ’ t have the right tread for me .#### #### ####[]
Shoes felt too long at first , like clown shoes , but the next size down from my usual size 9 would be too snug , so I 've worn them anyway and I was able to get over feeling ridiculous in them , mostly because they were pretty comfortable ( but beware : not much arch support ) .#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
The second pair I bought were great but the sole does n't last long .#### #### ####[([9], [10, 11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]
The boot seemed great , but they sent me 2 different sizes in the same right foot !#### #### ####[]
No zipper so absence of a pull-on tab makes these tough to get on .#### #### ####[]
You will be able to get them on , but then feel like you ’ re losing all circulation in your feet .#### #### ####[]
After one day , the sole unglued#### #### ####[]
The lining is so thin that you can feel the little square tops where the plastic sole is glued to the upper .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
They look and fit great but they have no cushion or arch support .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([3], [4], 'POS')]
They look nice , but not the most comfortable .#### #### ####[([1], [2], 'POS')]
Nice , have purchased Red now .#### #### ####[]
They 're beautiful and as pictured .#### #### ####[]
They were really large and clunky so she decided to get the Ahnu , Octabias that were waterproof also but fit better and#### #### ####[]
They are extremely comfortable and warm .#### #### ####[]
Otherwise , they are comfortable and easy to walk in#### #### ####[]
They are easy to get on and off .#### #### ####[]
I walked over ice and felt the cold on my feet for a good 30 minutes after maybe longer .#### #### ####[]

Still could n't maneuver my ankle to get it in the boot .#### #### ####[]
Got this one in a 7.5 and it 's too small in length .#### #### ####[([12], [9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
They were narrow and for the price not very comfortable .#### #### ####[]
Big but fit well with socks .#### #### ####[]
Also , don ’ t expect your feet to be warm without cashmere or wool socks .#### #### ####[]
First time ordering shoes for myself on line and they fit ...#### #### ####[]
Toes were freezing the first time I wore these shoes .#### #### ####[]
They are beautiful and comfortable .#### #### ####[]
Surprised with how well these fit and look .#### #### ####[([5], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [3], 'POS')]
Many , many years ago , I used to have an almost identical style ( in leather ) purchased from Eddie Bauer .#### #### ####[]
These are quite thin and NOT at all designed for cold temperatures .#### #### ####[]
The front of this boot is way to high on the ankle .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]

It ’ s a comfortable classy looking boot .#### #### ####[([7], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([7], [4], 'POS')]
Even though I can not walk in these , I can still tell they are quality made , nice looking , warm & comfortable in every way I need them to be so , I recommend these slippers .#### #### ####[]
The right boot was smaller than the other .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

However this is the first pair that has scuffed right out of the box .#### #### ####[]
Be sure to check the fit on each pair of these boots when you receive them to be sure they are correct , even if the printed size on the boots is what you ordered .#### #### ####[]
Love the fit , style and design of these boots but as you can see from photo they did not look good for long .#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [0], 'POS'), ([6], [0], 'POS')]
Far too narrow to even stretch .#### #### ####[]
Regular shoe polish and a little elbow grease keeps them spiffy and looking as good as new .#### #### ####[]
So to be sure I ordered ( from the Blundstone site as the next size up in amazon would take a long time ) AUS 7 ( US 8 ) and Aus 7.5 ( US.85 ) and both were a little too big lengthwise .... the 7 fit good in width but the 7.5 was not tight at all ( half sizes only mean more material on the instep ) I I ended up keeping the AUS 6 ( US 7 ) , reminder I normally wear an 8.5 in Nike Free , J & M , Clarks , etc .#### #### ####[]
If they bothered me walking from the family room to the kitchen I have to assume they wouldn ’ t be comfortable going anywhere , definitely not hiking or playing in the snow .#### #### ####[]
I 've never had to wear a wide shoe .#### #### ####[]
Work well for cold weather and mucking out corrals .#### #### ####[]
I think a 10 would be too big .#### #### ####[]
Feet stay warm and dry .#### #### ####[]
The top of the boot runs my leg raw if I wear them two days in a row .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
These are sturdy and comfortable and SLIP ON .#### #### ####[]
So , to be fair I do have a wider ball of my foot area .#### #### ####[]
They do n't stay tied at top .#### #### ####[]
Will order the other two colors !#### #### ####[]
Yes , the sole/platform of the shoe wont stretch , but the leather around the toes did a little for me ( for me walking up and downhill where my toes were pushed in the toebox ) .#### #### ####[([11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'NEG'), ([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8], 'NEG')]
After just a few hours of wearing them , the heel started to come through the inside of the shoe .#### #### ####[]
Way too small , I tried making them worn in , used thick socks , gave it a few weeks of pain , even used silicone ankle protectors but they are not a size 5 as advertised .#### #### ####[]
They are comfortable and cute#### #### ####[]
Perfect fit , super comfy , good quality , & light weight .#### #### ####[]
These are comfortable , warm and water proof .#### #### ####[]
-the laces the shoe comes with are long and come untied easily , have to tie them super tight .#### #### ####[([1], [7], 'NEG'), ([1], [9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
They go with everything from leggings , blue jeans to skirts and dresses .#### #### ####[]
No support on the inside , which I would have expected from this brand .#### #### ####[]
the 1st day I whore the shoes the let heel separated .#### #### ####[]
They are warm and look nice .#### #### ####[]
To wear to work very comfortable#### #### ####[]
Definitely not waterproof , even after spraying them .#### #### ####[]
I returned these because they were way too stiff and small .#### #### ####[]
My wife has a high instep so getting these on without zippers or Velcro was near impossible .#### #### ####[]
I wanted to love them but I do n't have two RIGHT feet .#### #### ####[]
When you walked in them they made a plastic sound !#### #### ####[]
They fit well at my regular size ( # 8 ) - and are comfortable .#### #### ####[]
Love the black eyelets and stitching .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [0], 'POS'), ([5], [0], 'POS')]
They feel sturdy and fit exactly as expected .#### #### ####[]

I have wide feet so I ordered a size up and the width was perfect .#### #### ####[([12], [14], 'POS')]
The description of the boots say that they are water resistant - they are not .#### #### ####[]

I have a terribly high arch and week ankles .#### #### ####[]
My heel slides out the top if the shoes are not laced tightly , and as my title suggests , they do not stay tied at all .#### #### ####[]
Doesn ’ t have support , honestly really uncomfortable leaving pain on my feet .#### #### ####[]

Overall , these are basic boots designed for quick errands when you do n't want to tie or otherwise ruin your better shoes .#### #### ####[]
The buckle is adjustable so simply loosen the notch one and it 's easier , but also they loosen up after taking off and on a few times .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [13], 'POS')]
Wearing a mens 8.5 us and knowing that the shoe runs large I ordered the mens ' 7 ' from the site ( sizing 1.5 sizes down ) .#### #### ####[]
I ordered my correct size based off reviews I read saying they fit true to size .#### #### ####[]
They were a little lighter than displayed in the picture .#### #### ####[]
If I wear tall socks they are totally comfortable .#### #### ####[]
Makes getting ready in the morning easy#### #### ####[]
They got so many mixed reviews I did n't know which way to go , order them bigger order a size down .. aahhhh , too much .#### #### ####[]
Very pretty and had great soles to keep traction in the snow/rain/ice .#### #### ####[]
They 're not my favorite by any means , but they 're cute enough and versatile .#### #### ####[]
Way to bright if red .#### #### ####[]
The rubber sole is good enough for me to take the trash out and they are nice and warm !#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS')]
I 'm obsessed with these shoes they 're so comfortable .#### #### ####[([5], [9], 'POS')]

The top will rub blisters on your legs- wear them with long thick socks .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
So if you 're 10 a 9.5 will fit better than the 10 .#### #### ####[]
But the actual color was quite warm and more of a sienna shade .#### #### ####[([3], [6], 'POS')]
The sole part is a bit hard but nothing that a decent inner sole won ’ t fix so all in all a good buy .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [6], 'NEG')]
And they kept my feet dry ( we did hike through quite a bit of snow pack ) and I never had an issue with traction .#### #### ####[]
Buyer beware if your hard on your boots ... might not be for you .#### #### ####[]
They are easy to slip on to do a quick chore outside and keep my feet dry and warm .#### #### ####[]
So if you have super wide feet this shoe may not be for you .#### #### ####[]
Made cheap and the material is very thin .#### #### ####[([4], [7], 'NEG')]
BUT , one shoe was ( painfully ) shorter than the other so unfortunately I am returning them but if they did fit , I would keep them .#### #### ####[]
They fit really well and stay on my feet .#### #### ####[]
I 've seen some reviews complaining that they are hard to get off and on .#### #### ####[]
I feel like I have normal sized feet .#### #### ####[]
Love the color as they match my Mrs .#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'POS')]
These were nice comfortable boots but I had to return them as they were too big , I ordered a size 5 and they were too loose so felt like my feet would come out of them .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]
Very cute and my daughter loved the look .#### #### ####[([7], [1], 'POS')]
They are well made , though , and have been holding up well in the PNW .#### #### ####[]

As you can see in the picture they went great with a dress and the following day the looked just as great with a pair of jeans .#### #### ####[]
The material was also very cheap .#### #### ####[([1], [5], 'NEG')]
Incredibly comfortable and warm -- the perfect boots for winter , I 'm beyond pleased with their quality , durability and fit .#### #### ####[([17], [14], 'POS'), ([19], [14], 'POS'), ([21], [14], 'POS')]
As a person with very narrow feet , I am always thrilled to find something that will work for me .#### #### ####[]
They ran small and had to send them back did n't re-order because I was afraid they 'd be too big .#### #### ####[]
This shoe is so cute and classy .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([1], [6], 'POS')]
Let me first say , the photos of the boots on Amazon worn by other people are adorable .#### #### ####[]
I have the natural ( sand ) color but would love to order another pair .#### #### ####[]
Both of these boot split at the seam where the big toe is .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]

It 's really not that difficult .#### #### ####[]
Early morning grass is foot soaker for sneakers on the farm .#### #### ####[]
These slippers look more like regular shoes then most slippers do , so I do n't feel so awkward going out in public wearing slippers .#### #### ####[]
Fit really snug but that 's kinda to be expected of dr. Martens .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS')]
But if too much weather exposure , they shrink .#### #### ####[]
I ordered them a size big , to make sure I had room for think socks .#### #### ####[]
My old pair had worn down significantly and I was looking for something cute with good tread to replace them .#### #### ####[]
The soles were also insanely hard which I don ’ t think would be very comfortable to walk around in kind either .#### #### ####[([1], [5], 'NEG')]
Ok , so when I first put them on I was a little scared because they went on snug but once they were on I had plenty of wiggle room in my toes and that 's with the thick socks I put on to insure a true fit .#### #### ####[]
The heel felt weirdly loose for me , so I ended up returning these and got a different style of boot .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4], 'NEG')]
They remind me of my favorite old Uggs but the fur detail and buckle make them more stylish .#### #### ####[([10, 11, 12, 13], [17], 'POS')]
I found that out because I thought/was told from the Amazon question section that it reflected the AUS sizing .#### #### ####[]
I ordered a womens 8 and got a mens 7. while I realize that they consider that the same size , i feel like the mens shoe is a little wider and doesnt make my foot feel secure .#### #### ####[([25, 26], [29, 30], 'NEG'), ([25, 26], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], 'NEG')]
They run a bit large but I think a smaller size would be too small .#### #### ####[]
Coming apart with such little use is unacceptable .#### #### ####[]
Felt cheap , flimsy , and definitely not waterproof .#### #### ####[]
I wore them for 5 or so hours at a muddy wine festival and my feet stayed dry an comfy .#### #### ####[]
Tall socks completely eliminated that issue for me#### #### ####[]
It is too narrow and tight .#### #### ####[]
Standard comfort you would expect from an ankle boot .#### #### ####[]
I put my orthotic in over the top of the gel-like insert and I wear these boots with thin socks .#### #### ####[]
They are comfortable and will make nice house slippers .#### #### ####[]
Love them but they scuff easily#### #### ####[]

I can not slip these on with ease , as with all my other pairs .#### #### ####[]
I 've honestly been wearing them almost every day since I received them !#### #### ####[]
The ankle is wide , the foot is not#### #### ####[]
I wear 7-1/2M shoe size , and ordered both 7-1/2M and 8M , but both sizes were too short .#### #### ####[]
They are warm and light weight .#### #### ####[]
These are NOT for cold weather as advertised .#### #### ####[]
Exactly like they are supposed to but look cheap in person#### #### ####[]
Does n't hurt your feet with prolonged standing !#### #### ####[]
Lightweight and easy to put on my college age daughter loves them#### #### ####[]

But they are so cute !#### #### ####[]
Great Fashion Boot - Super Comfortable !#### #### ####[([2], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([2], [0, 1], 'POS')]
Returned them because they were way to small .#### #### ####[]
I 'm a female with very wide feet , so I purchased the mens boots .#### #### ####[]
I was also concerned about them feeling big at the top of my feet but now I do like that I ’ ve ordered a half size larger because this winter I ’ m wearing thicker socks .#### #### ####[]
I was concerned about the lack of breathing since they are synthetic but that ’ s not an issue at all .#### #### ####[]
Seems a little stiff or cheaply made .#### #### ####[]
In person , however , the boots look very juvenile .#### #### ####[([6], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
It 's painful to walk in .#### #### ####[]

This rain bootie is very comfortable !#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS')]
The picture does n't give it justice because they are simply adorable in person 😍 granted tho not the best to try and bend down in but they just have to be broken in ☺️#### #### ####[]
Though the smell lessens with time , it is still there - and annoying to anyone who is sensitive to smells .#### #### ####[]
The toe taper on big toe side squeezes and rubs big toe .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]

Would not have been a comfortable walking shoe .#### #### ####[]

These look just like the more expensive Dolce Vita version and they are so comfortable and true to size .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m normally a size 6 1/2 or 7 .#### #### ####[]
The only reason they did n't get 5 stars is that they are very difficult to get on .#### #### ####[]

They are true to size , very water proof and high enough to keep my socks dry and clean .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly surprised by their comfort !#### #### ####[([6], [2, 3], 'POS')]
I ordered a size 10 but the boot either ran small or I was sent the wrong size .#### #### ####[]
It appears it is more decorative than functional to help get your boots on .#### #### ####[]
The dew on the grass soaked through .#### #### ####[]
As to the fit , When I bought the first pair I was told to size up .#### #### ####[]
They are so warm and comfortable !#### #### ####[]
The top area of the shoe is a sharp cheap plastic .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]
Perhaps if they were 2 sizes larger .#### #### ####[]
It took a long time tp arrive and I have been very dissatisfied as the shaft of the boot is so small it is very difficult to put theses boots on .#### #### ####[([15, 16, 17, 18], [21], 'NEG')]
So the biggest problem for me was the quality of workmanship .#### #### ####[]
I sized down should n't have !#### #### ####[]
I was barely able to put them on once .#### #### ####[]
The glow last for 5-10 mins after charging .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'POS')]

They are super comfortable and very stylish .#### #### ####[]
Although not as wide as expected , I would have kept these EXCEPT for the strangely solid arch support .#### #### ####[([17, 18], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
Do not order for winter they have no warmth and no traction .#### #### ####[]
I 've worn much comfortable boots like this .#### #### ####[([5], [2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
Loved loved these in the picture online , however , you can not even get the bootie on your foot , there needs to be a back or side zipper , so disappointed#### #### ####[]
These are cute but were cheap and uncomfortable .#### #### ####[]
The material is really stiff and looks cheap .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG'), ([1], [6, 7], 'NEG')]
Wearing them daily no matter what the weather !#### #### ####[]
I probably could n't fit thick socks on in these ( but also bought the next size up for colder weather .#### #### ####[]
A couple of months later they are nearly unwearable as professional shoes .#### #### ####[]
These are the perfect casual boot to wear with jeans and a sweater .#### #### ####[]
Not sure why they look so dry and not like a good brown leather like the sales photo .#### #### ####[([4], [6], 'NEG')]
It would make it easier to put them on and off .#### #### ####[]
They do get a little uncomfortable after several hours though#### #### ####[]
I love the side zipper as well .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [1], 'POS')]
But 4 stars because they LOOK great !#### #### ####[]
A great quality item just excruciatingly hard to get it on so .... you might be just fine with it .#### #### ####[]

I could not even get my foot in my normal size .#### #### ####[]

look good with slacks and jeans .#### #### ####[]
Not great ... the top of the boot is wider then I like , I would have liked it to be snug for a longer leg look .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
My first pair definitely are waterproof and provide great insulation even in 5 degree Michigan winters .#### #### ####[]
I like that the elastic allows for some stretch to make putting them on easily , but the ankle area feels tight enough that they do n't slip off my feet .#### #### ####[([4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([18, 19, 20, 21, 22], [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'POS')]
They fit perfectly , plenty of width even when I wear double socks .#### #### ####[]
Their too big no support around the ankles almost like house shoes , should be sold as house shoes not boots , not even close😒 bad packaging made the shoes like worn down .#### #### ####[]
Which is something I struggle with finding in most shoes .#### #### ####[]
Nice rain boots I did n't have them a long time , but when I started wearing them on rainy days , I notice about 6 wears the material started cracking and got holes .#### #### ####[([28], [32, 33], 'NEG'), ([28], [29, 30], 'NEG')]
But they felt very comfy and were very lightweight which is what I was looking for .#### #### ####[]
Why are some shoes made with that awful fuzzy stuff on the ball of the shoe so there is no traction ?#### #### ####[]
Will not be able to wear a thick sock .#### #### ####[]
The heel was a little bit too big for me , but I do have narrow heels/ankles .#### #### ####[([1], [6, 7], 'NEG')]
They came missing so many studs 🥺 I can ’ t wear them now .#### #### ####[]
The brown had quite a bit of yellow in it , and was n't as dark as I was expecting .#### #### ####[]
I have pretty narrow feet but even these were a bit too narrow for me .#### #### ####[]
-They squeak some , like leather on leather , when you walk .#### #### ####[]
They look sexy , the only con is they cut into my left ankle .#### #### ####[([1], [2], 'POS')]
Having a wide foot ( and somewhat of a flat foot ) , these boots hurt my heel and ankle areas .#### #### ####[([14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'NEG')]
For the sale these were on , great value for a sharp looking pair of Timberland boots .#### #### ####[]

I was able to wear them all night with no issues .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m typically a 7.5 , went to an 8 and they fit perfectly .#### #### ####[]
They 're comfortable too with the perfect heel height .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [6], 'POS')]
Unfortunately they are too small and not available in sizes larger than 11 .#### #### ####[]
But these are tight , maybe they need some time to stretch and mold around my foot but I do n't think it will work out .#### #### ####[]
They are super cute and so far are holding up really well !#### #### ####[]
Probably not great for narrow feet .#### #### ####[]
These are about a half size too small .#### #### ####[]

Could be a defective shoe because I can see if it was ever seen in the spots where it has come apart .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'NEG')]

It has no shape , it 's not true to size and the bottom is a fall waiting to slip on ice .#### #### ####[([13], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 'NEG')]
Great for muddy wet forest walks .#### #### ####[]
When I received them , they did not look charcoal at all , but a darker brown instead .#### #### ####[]

I have one foot wider than the other which requires me to buy wide width shoes .#### #### ####[]
I have always worn these with thicker socks to prevent irritation from where the tongue hits the foot .. First I have purchased in this style but love where they sit because they do n't hurt my weak ankle from an old injury .#### #### ####[]
These are darling , and I wore them twice all day at work on my feet with no problems .#### #### ####[]
If I continue to wear these I will always have to wear tall socks that keep the shoes from rubbing my ankle .#### #### ####[]
I ordered thinking they would be easy slip on boots , that was not the case for me .#### #### ####[]
I 'm a person that cant stand shoes that are too big or have too much room , especially being in a chelsea boot because there are no ties .#### #### ####[]
Putting it along side another shoe of the same size , this boot is about 1-1/2 inches shorter .#### #### ####[([12], [14, 15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]

Tried getting a size smaller and it was still too big in those areas despite being to short in length .#### #### ####[]

-they seem to get scratched easily#### #### ####[]
The only downside was the smell they arrived with but I quickly went away ( factory smell ) .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [2], 'NEG')]
So your toes actually hung over the insole .#### #### ####[]
I fell three times and then had to give up wearing these .#### #### ####[]
One piece of molded rubber ; no seams for water to penetrate .#### #### ####[]
Sooo cute and just the right height !#### #### ####[]
The soles are very hard , so they are uncomfortable , and the material is VERY cheap .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG'), ([13], [16], 'NEG')]
They are not even 6 months old .#### #### ####[]

There is a cushiony feeling under my feet .#### #### ####[]
These are so cute and comfortable .#### #### ####[]

The insert needs to be replaced if you plan to wear them all day .#### #### ####[]
I saw many comments saying they are tight to put on .#### #### ####[]
They do n't even look the same .#### #### ####[]
Sure they hurt after a few hours but that 's expected .#### #### ####[]
As a teacher on my feet all day , it is not easy finding shoes that feel good and look good .#### #### ####[]

I noticed in a lot of reviews that there was a strong leather smell , not at all , just the yummy leather scent you want from a nice pair of boots .#### #### ####[]

I 've only had this boots for 3 weeks so I 'm not sure how the velvet will hold , but it 's definetly not a pair of boot for being in the rain or doing any serious work with them .#### #### ####[]

Well I went with a half size down , since that 's what I seen most in the reviews is that they ran bigger than smaller .#### #### ####[]
On a cold day , I take out the Propét insert and put in my orthotic so that I can wear these with warm thick socks .#### #### ####[]

I ’ m now sold on these boots for the comfort and beauty .#### #### ####[([7], [10], 'POS'), ([7], [12], 'POS')]
Fit is true to size .#### #### ####[([0], [2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
I also loved the bottom of the boots as they seem to have a lot of traction .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [2], 'POS'), ([4, 5, 6, 7], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS')]
They literally match with every outfit .#### #### ####[]
i have worn 5.5 for years , order 5.5 way to big , then order 5 , again to big so 4.5 my toe is at the very end .#### #### ####[]
In ordering a size “ wide ” , I was hoping it would accommodate but it was too narrow still on my foot .#### #### ####[]
They do really well repelling water and have a nice rubber sole .#### #### ####[]
One in i had enough toe/foot room but hard sean hit top of my foot .#### #### ####[]
Quality seemed good , but had to return .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS')]

They felt very cheap and fragile .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG'), ([1], [5], 'NEG')]
however , they do still look really good .#### #### ####[]
Even my socks end up smelling like rubber .#### #### ####[]
I ❤️ these boots so much that I also bought them in brown !#### #### ####[]
Its a shame as length wise they were perfect and really great quality .#### #### ####[([4], [8], 'POS')]
My sister is a 10 and tried them on and also had a huge struggle to get in on .#### #### ####[]
I purchased 1 size larger than my usual so once winter comes , I can wear thick socks for extra warmth , and that worked out just like I thought it would .#### #### ####[]
Crease on top of shoe is prominent very quickly .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]

If you ’ re just looking for a warmer , cute boot for a snowless winter , these would work great !#### #### ####[]
When the boots were brand new they were a little bit of a tight fit and as time went on they loosened up but I do like them enough where I bought two more pair before prices go up and they don ’ t make your feet sweat at least for me .#### #### ####[([2], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
It came as a US mens 7/AUS mens 6 .... At first I thought it was tight and unwearable , although my toes were up in the toebox but not touching , it was just tight .#### #### ####[]
The part on top of the foot really dug into my ankle ...#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
Did not seem to be waterproof but did keep my feet warm and I did get compliments on the look and style .#### #### ####[([19], [16], 'POS'), ([21], [16], 'POS')]
So comfortable you forget you are wearing shoes .#### #### ####[]
Very soft on the inside , snd waterproof on the outside .#### #### ####[]
They are not made to last .#### #### ####[]
They were way too big to wear with out socks .#### #### ####[]
This works well for me .#### #### ####[]
The size 7 's were way too small .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3], [6, 7], 'NEG')]
I do n't have wide feet and they 're way too narrow .#### #### ####[]
I had to buy a shoe cushion to be able to use them .#### #### ####[]
Your toes will constantly hit the front of the shoes and rub against the material , I had socks on and I still ended up with blisters and sore toes .#### #### ####[]
Also they are quite short , so if your wearing skinny jeans , they do n't fit into the boots .#### #### ####[]
I am very disappointed with this , it was so hard and the booths buttom is so hard not worthy#### #### ####[([13, 14], [17, 18, 19], 'NEG')]

It 's a shame because they are beautiful but so ridiculousness narrow even with ordering the `` wide '' width I could n't wear them#### #### ####[]
I was anticipating my feet would hurt , and to my surprise I didn ’ t have any issues !#### #### ####[]

They clean up pretty easily too and I do plan on giving them a fresh weatherproofing treatment soon just to make sure they last a long time because I love them so much !#### #### ####[]
I just ordered a pair of men 's for my hubby as we 're going hiking to the Rainforest and these are also waterproof .#### #### ####[]
Definitely not water resistant at all , but super pliable and comfortable .#### #### ####[]
They 've been really helpful with snow and rain , and the tread is really thick .#### #### ####[([12], [15], 'POS')]
They also keep my feet nice & warm and are easy to slip on .#### #### ####[]
Love the boot and style but had to return because they were way to small , I went up in size but they were far to narrow and tight , I couldnt even get them on .#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [0], 'POS')]
I kept wearing them with bandages on ever toe .#### #### ####[]
Reordered and hoping my next pair come in without damage .. would be a 5 star review if not for the damage on the shoe .#### #### ####[]
Never wore them and they are already scuffed .#### #### ####[]
Keeps my teeth so much cleaner than a regular toothbrush .#### #### ####[]
It still worked great , but without the brushes it was useless .#### #### ####[]
It 's a very good tooth brush but a little hard to assemble since the instructions are n't that great .#### #### ####[([12], [10], 'NEG'), ([15], [16, 17, 18, 19], 'NEG')]
The interval timer resets if you accidently hit the on/off or mode switch for just a split second ( this would n't happen with sonicare ) .#### #### ####[]
I prefer this model because it comes with a base unlike the previous , less expensive model .#### #### ####[]
2 ) The slight uneven edges work well with the circular rotation and I could feel I was reaching some of the crevices better if I moved the brush additionally from left to right .#### #### ####[]
I like the small brush on this .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [1], 'POS')]
I bought in February , and it has stopped working !#### #### ####[]
Then I have to restart to continue my routine .#### #### ####[]
Cleans really well , brightens teeth , has multiple speed settings and even tells you when you 're applying too much pressure .#### #### ####[]
Product motor burned out and doesn ’ t recharge within a month of buying .#### #### ####[]
The vibration is too much it ’ s shocks the living life out of me ! !#### #### ####[([1], [3, 4], 'NEG')]
I really like the lightweight and soft feel .#### #### ####[]
It comes with 5 heads for each base , UV light to sanitize , and amazing battery life .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [15], 'POS')]
I stopped using it and went back to my manual brush .#### #### ####[]
This item was great , until it was n't .#### #### ####[]
Been using for 3 weeks without having to charge .#### #### ####[]
Pretty design .. CONS : wish there was a head cover so its hygenically kept not exposed .#### #### ####[]
Stopped working after two years ; what a wast could of got a lower cost model for less than half the price .#### #### ####[]
The weak vibrations of the quip can ’ t can ’ t be doing squat .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'NEG')]
The second time , it stopped charging five days after the 30-day return window closed .#### #### ####[]
Maybe its because before I had a toothbrush that stopped after 2 '' and you had to press it again to restart , but at first I found this annoying .#### #### ####[]
Love the built in 2 minute timer that beeps gently after each 30 seconds so each quadrant gets the proper amount of brushing .#### #### ####[]
Thankfully , I did not swallow any of it ( that I am aware of ) .#### #### ####[]
I love the multiple options .#### #### ####[]
I needs to be on the charger 24/7 can ’ t take it on trips cause within the hour it ’ s dead .#### #### ####[]
The brush barely works as an electric toothbrush and can only really be used as a normal brush at this point almost 2 months in .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

The battery life is very good .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS')]
But at that point , yeah , I think a reasonable person could determine on their own , without the aid of “ advanced pressure sensing technology ” , that they might be applying a bit too much pressure .#### #### ####[]
Very bad construction and stopped working after just 15 months .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'NEG')]
It does not fit the Colgate 360 brush or any other brush I could find#### #### ####[]
The brush vibrates extremely fast ; so much so that my husband refuses to use his .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4], 'NEG')]
I also have my wisdom teeth and the small head makes it much easier to keep those clean as well .#### #### ####[]
This was great for the first few weeks , then the second bruch piece stopped charging and is now useless .#### #### ####[]
Only came with 7 brush heads .#### #### ####[]
Can barely last through one brushing without needing to be recharged .#### #### ####[]
Finish is chipping off every time I brush .#### #### ####[]
This did n't work for me .#### #### ####[]
It sits on the charger all day , but still will not turn on .#### #### ####[]
Has a 2 min timer which pauses every 30secs and 4 different modes.would recommend to friends and family .#### #### ####[]
I do n't like that the head sometimes comes off while I 'm brushing my teeth ( it turns to lock in place but then unlocks while I 'm turning it to brush my teeth ) .#### #### ####[([6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]

I expected it to be exactly the same and was shocked to notice that it did not have a power plug , but a USB .#### #### ####[]
This was a gift and I am very upset that it didnt last longer .#### #### ####[]
Comparing the quip to any electric toothbrush is a fallacy , as the quip motor only vibrates the handle and not the brush .#### #### ####[([13, 14], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'NEG')]
It 's no longer convienent when I have to bring an extra charger and extra type of cable just so I can charge this because Phillips was too lazy to just put one extra pull-up resistor into their charging circuit board ( this less-than-a-tenth-of-a-cent component is literally the only thing they needed to add to avoid this ) .#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [2, 3, 4], 'NEG')]
I also find I have to be extra careful because it literally sprays toothpaste everywhere .#### #### ####[]
It was supposed to last 3 months .#### #### ####[]
( It 's not hard , just keep it sideways until you 're done and wipe it off . )#### #### ####[]
And won ’ t charged on either pad .#### #### ####[]
She was the typical kid brusher-often just standing with the toothbrush in her mouth for 2 minutes with minimal quality brushing .#### #### ####[]
Our first model had NiCad batteries and lasted nearly 15 years , the next ( now 5+ year ) has NiMH battery and seems to work fine now with one user instead of 2 .#### #### ####[]
I like that it does n't take up a lot of space .#### #### ####[]
After using for a week and cleaning after each brush session , still experienced mold growth in the brush-head .#### #### ####[]
Also the dentist kept telling me to not brush so hard .#### #### ####[]
In my opinion , the vibration is not strong enough to really clean my teeth .#### #### ####[([5], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
After 2 months of use they only stay charged for about a week .#### #### ####[]

I ’ m still learning it ’ s features and options .#### #### ####[]
Down side is they do not come with cube for charging or even a regular plug .#### #### ####[]
It does a much better tooth cleaning than just a toothbrush .#### #### ####[]
This is the same exact case , and so convenient for traveling .#### #### ####[]
This one works just as well and costs a third of the others .#### #### ####[]
I opened the packaging and popped the part on the bottom for the charger port and part of the brush handle chipped and could see the wiring .#### #### ####[]
This worked great for 10 months .#### #### ####[]

The button no longer working and the design is bad , since it has a lot of grooves ( pic attached ) the water can get there and it will stink really fast and require you to clean it frequently which is something no one has time for compared to regular toothbrush , if you got a new one just make sure to dry it completely before you put it down and make sure no water get into the groove of the battery or the groove that attached the toothbrush head to the body of the toothbrush#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4], 'NEG'), ([7], [9], 'NEG')]

Another aid is a light indicating the pressure you are using to brush .#### #### ####[]
I then went to Walmart and tried the ones on the package and they all had really weak motors too .#### #### ####[]
I really want to like this toothbrush set , but I ca n't get over the toothbrush head .#### #### ####[]
Despite multiple attempts at charging it using multiple outlets and thoroughly reading the instructions , I could never get it to turn on .#### #### ####[]
Attempt number three while cycling the settings : Soft is the one for me .#### #### ####[]
It works very well , and it ’ s much cheaper than name brands .#### #### ####[]

brushing is effective but large non ergonomic design#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS')]
The brush was awful too , cut my gums gave me an infection on the 1st day , had to take antibiotics .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG')]
It showed a stand but DID NOT come with one and now it is not working ?#### #### ####[([3], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
The only problem is that we found it impossible to remove the brush head .#### #### ####[]
We both immediately noticed that our teeth felt and looked like they were professionally cleaned .#### #### ####[]
It is pretty noisy , but that ’ s easy to ignore once you realize what a great job it ’ s doing : )#### #### ####[]
I love that it connects to my phone using bluetooth .#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [1], 'POS')]
It allows it to air out when travelling and also is quite compact .#### #### ####[]
I thought perhaps I was pressing too hard so I lightened up , but it still would n't stay on .#### #### ####[]
I felt my teeth were not as clean after using the toothbrush ..#### #### ####[]
it is good for short stop travel#### #### ####[]
I got 2units for my 2kids ... the other one is totally not working anymore , even it is fully charged .#### #### ####[]

This brush makes lots of rattling noise .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]

There ’ s no point and you have to ouch the button to cycle through them .#### #### ####[]
When it does , it drips onto the stand /charger and you wind up having to scrape off the hardened toothpaste .#### #### ####[]
Ok product , tooth brush attachment too small in my opinion .#### #### ####[([3, 4, 5], [6, 7], 'NEG')]

Stopped working after about 5 months .#### #### ####[]
A rotating brush head that is hearty but limited .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3], [6], 'POS'), ([1, 2, 3], [8], 'NEG')]

I have sensitive teeth so I bleed easily , here I can put it in sensitive mode .#### #### ####[]

And then you have to devote half a day to finding the right replacement heads ..... I may go back to the old fashioned teeth cleaning ...#### #### ####[]
I did n't work for me , I 'd suggest buying from a real brand , that has actual options as far bristles .#### #### ####[]

Its cleans well and invigorates the gums .#### #### ####[]
I had been using an oscillating electric toothbrush for years but the brushes tend to break and stop moving .#### #### ####[]
It certainly left my teeth feeling smooth .#### #### ####[]
My toddlers have never liked brushing their teeth but they love using this toothbrush !#### #### ####[]
The battery is fully charged .#### #### ####[]
It just devours battery ’ s though .#### #### ####[]
this cleans just fine , but it does n't stand up steadily on the charger .#### #### ####[]
At the recommendation of my dentist , I paid extra and bought a soft bristled head ( the ones that come with the brush are not soft ) , but after all the research I did , I obviously made a mistake and bought the wrong model .#### #### ####[([18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], [25, 26], 'NEG')]

It is so strong that it flings the toothpaste off the toothbrush itself .#### #### ####[]

Five stars for battery life though , the product died before needing to be recharged .#### #### ####[]

vibrates too much and hurts my gums .#### #### ####[]
This product says it ’ s for adults and kids , there is no way a kid could be able to use this .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s very nice but after several weeks it does not hold its charge .#### #### ####[]
I run it three times longer than suggested and I guess it ’ s just not the product for someone who likes clean teeth .#### #### ####[]
My teeth feel great every time I use it .#### #### ####[]
The `` case '' for these is a tube with very tiny holes that does n't offer a lot of airflow to actually dry the toothbrushes out .#### #### ####[]

Any quality tests done on this ?#### #### ####[]
Knocked me a bit for a loop at first and the whirring sounded like a rocket against my teeth but it gave me a very clean sensation .#### #### ####[]
First I was surprised how difficult it was just to press the button to turn it on .#### #### ####[]
This worked when it arrived , but began registering phantom keypressess and cycling through modes without the button being pressed .#### #### ####[]
As other reviewers have pointed out , the box only comes with one brush head , even though the description states that two brush heads are included ( I noticed that they finally changed this ) .#### #### ####[]
Looks just like the more expensive models but without the useless Bluetooth .#### #### ####[]
I decided to change the battery - that was another adventure .#### #### ####[]
I might add that dental checkups improved dramatically after adopting this system some 20 years ago .#### #### ####[]
For the first month they were fine but after that the charge started getting progressively worst .#### #### ####[]

If the adapter was smaller you could fit it in the travel case !#### #### ####[]
The brush will pause every 30 seconds so you can switch sides/ move to another section of your mouth ; but I feel like if I were to brush one section for 30 seconds it would tear my gums up !#### #### ####[]

I might get a couple of fast brushings out of it , but then it bogs down again .#### #### ####[]
I bought the Quip for travelling because its small , but it 's so nice that I have n't used the Oral-B brush since .#### #### ####[]
I sometimes have to use my second hand to press it closed .#### #### ####[]

Feels more like dusting the surface rather than a deep clean .#### #### ####[]

I charged the toothbrush in the morning .#### #### ####[]
This is ONLY compatible with the A to C style cables which essentially only exist as a temporary measure until USB C is the only connector in use .#### #### ####[]

I tried to `` fix '' this by thoroughly drying the head and only attaching it when I went to use it , but it just keeps dripping water every time I use it .#### #### ####[]

The product didn ’ t work enough to get a good review#### #### ####[]
I bought 2 of these , and both of them broke in the same way as other recent reviews .#### #### ####[]
My gums have receded from brushing too hard so I have to be careful when I brush .#### #### ####[]
Do n't expect a really good clean#### #### ####[]
Should we be charging it by connecting to computer ?#### #### ####[]
I then checked other reviews and found many others experienced the same problem and many in fact broke the handle while trying to open the head .#### #### ####[]

I used the toothbrush for about 1 month and then to clean the product I tried to open the brush head , but it was too tight .#### #### ####[([19, 20], [25, 26], 'NEG')]

The bristles also seem to wear out more quickly than my previous brand .#### #### ####[([1], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
This allows water to enter the brush-head easily and the inside of the brush-head lacks any sort of anti-microbial lining to prevent the growth of mold .#### #### ####[([10, 11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'NEG')]

Not only does it make brushing your teeth fun , but I really feel like I 'm doing a much better job cleaning my teeth now than I was with my manual brush .#### #### ####[]
While it worked , it was great but it didn ’ t even last a year .#### #### ####[]
I love that it gives you timed start and stop .#### #### ####[]
It must be to do with the head of the toothbrush rotating while the base vibrates , as I 've never had an electric toothbrush like this one before ( I had a slightly older Sonicare model before I got this one ) .#### #### ####[]
I did n't realize it had a 2 minute timer on it so that was a nice surprise !#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9], [17], 'POS')]

It ’ s not very powerful when fully charged and definitely not as powerful as a normal electric toothbrush , I threw it away and went to Walmart and bought a better one .#### #### ####[]
All toll I have bought 5 and each one has had its issues .#### #### ####[]
Everything looks nice on the outside but I also notice that during the day , I am getting more build up than normal .#### #### ####[]
About 2-3 months after having it , it stopped accepting a charge and no longer worked .#### #### ####[]
Also , there are is n't a convenient way to share the toothbrush and app across different people .#### #### ####[]

There 's a protective film that covers each of them , and upon removing it , one of them also stripped part of the iridescent finish off of it🤬 stop that is the reason for giving it a 3🌟 rating in the durability department .#### #### ####[]

Helped my desk look less cluttered and cleaner .#### #### ####[]
Putting it together , one of the shelves had extra plastic and I had to file it down to fit properly .#### #### ####[]
It 's a little small but I do n't recommend this for people who have a lot of makeup .#### #### ####[]
The drawers are holding 6 bottles parts .#### #### ####[]

Too easy to come out of place .#### #### ####[]
Every single shelf is severely scratched and malformed down the center !#### #### ####[]
I more so put everyday day essentials on it and just put a couple of my everyday perfumes it .#### #### ####[]
I ’ m getting a set of small cork-stoppered apothecary bottles to make the meds & supplements I take not be such an eyesore , and those shelves will be the ones usually facing out into the room .#### #### ####[]
Nice heavy quality to it .#### #### ####[]
It is a good value for the convenience it provides !#### #### ####[]
So I decided to try and super glue it back together and there is a missing piece .#### #### ####[]
It seems really cheap and doesn ’ t even fit together correctly .#### #### ####[]
You can move and take out shelves and compartments if you want or don ’ t want them , as well as place them as you ’ d like .#### #### ####[]
The squares are also too tight for my larger lipstick cases so I have to find another holder to store all my inventory .#### #### ####[([1], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]

it definitely pushes your breast oddly , makes you a very odd shape .#### #### ####[]

It was tiring holding the flanges to my breasts , especially when I tried doing both at the same time , it was impractical if I wanted to do anything else .#### #### ####[]
Also be careful when setting down your baby .#### #### ####[]
Works good but after washing it over & over I notice my milk leaks out the bottom .#### #### ####[]
( Note that I do put these into a bottle and do not use the Kiinde nipples - my baby just does n't like them ) .#### #### ####[]
Please know that as wonderful as these are that you will likely have to get yourself maymom inserts or ( my favorite ) the beaugen cushions to give yourself the right ‘ fit ’ .#### #### ####[]
Suction- After the first 2 uses the Elvie stopped suctioning so once again would prolong my pump session .#### #### ####[]
I am currently pumping 7 times a day and also nursing 3-4 times a day so I needed a pumping bra that was versatile to allow me to do both and there are n't very many options out there that I could find that allowed me to do both .#### #### ####[]
Works great with my Spectra pump and wayyy more affordable !#### #### ####[]
I also found that the suction was not strong enough like my other pump and I hardly got much milk .#### #### ####[([5], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]

The only good thing is , they do n't stand out too much if you stick them in your bra .#### #### ####[]
It does a terrific job .#### #### ####[]
You can also tell you have them on if not placed properly .#### #### ####[]
That was in the beginning of my pumping journey and I do have sensitive nipples , but just something to look out for since the seam is rather thick .#### #### ####[]

At least 30 percent of the 100 count are of no use because the zips are misaligned .#### #### ####[([14], [16], 'NEG')]
And actually the duckbills have a little texture to them which makes them easier to pop off than the original spectra duckbills .#### #### ####[([3], [13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]

A definite upgrade from Medela Pump In Style .#### #### ####[]
I pump everywhere and use this all of the time !#### #### ####[]
It is also not convenient to pour the milk out of it .#### #### ####[]
Easy to write on as well !#### #### ####[]
I have the 27 mm Medela breastshields and bought these because the description seemed to suggest that these breastshields would have a wider radius measurements and might also be shorter as the Medela ones are rather long .#### #### ####[]
However , I ’ ve only had this pump less than 2 months and today one of the electric motors stopped charging and tonight the one that was working has started glitching and won ’ t work either .#### #### ####[]
Easy to use and easy to clean .#### #### ####[]
If you ever were to bend over to do laundry or pick something up off the floor , you lose whatever is in the shells .#### #### ####[]
I like that it ’ s hands free but it ’ s too loud and bulky .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [1], 'POS')]
It makes me easier to do with breast pump#### #### ####[]
I learned quickly not to go above a certain level because you can ’ t go down you have to cycle through to get back to#### #### ####[]
I also had similar problems with the threads being loose and the bottles coming off , but the thing that keeps me from using it is that the throat of the flange is too short .#### #### ####[([7], [8, 9], 'NEG'), ([12], [13, 14], 'NEG'), ([28, 29, 30, 31], [33, 34], 'NEG')]

I was more careful about making sure the bag would n't leak in that fashion , but then , today , the whole bag of milk -- a nearly full bag -- just fell to the floor , spilling breastmilk in my office , my clothes .#### #### ####[]
I use a lot of lanolin cream but still I have to limit my pumping sessions to 2-3 times per day simply due to pain .#### #### ####[]

Immediately I was able to relieve my full breasts and begin supplementing .#### #### ####[]
It goes up to 12 , but I find myself only going up to 6 or maybe 7 at the most .#### #### ####[]
I thought it worked pretty good at first but now I 'm on week 3 of using this pump and am noticing that the design is n't very good .#### #### ####[([24], [25, 26, 27, 28], 'NEG')]
I even would tape it together so it wouldn ’ t come apart .#### #### ####[]
You need a lot of pressure to keep the shell from leaking out of the inner silicone ring where your nipple sits .#### #### ####[]
I used my Medela for baby one and two with great success .#### #### ####[]
3. Who designed the bag-This carry case was very obviously created by a person who valued simplicity over anything else .#### #### ####[]
It 's a tight fit with the tubing , but once it 's on there are no problems with staying on or suction .#### #### ####[]

I am only halfway through the first box and have already had 4 defective pouches .#### #### ####[([14], [13], 'NEG')]
I do n't like how hard they were to open , they do n't store as much milk for carrying around as other brands , and the opening in the top seems smaller .#### #### ####[([9], [5], 'NEG'), ([27, 28, 29, 30], [32], 'NEG')]
Those pouch es need you to buy adaptors separately .#### #### ####[]
The machine is larger than the Medela , but not prohibitively so .#### #### ####[]

When I took off the silicone part there was dried up milk around the edges .#### #### ####[]

I used to have one of these that worked great so I got a new set from this company hoping to enjoy it just as much but if you so much as sneeze the seal slides and your milk just gets wasted .#### #### ####[]

I only hand wash them as I don ’ t have a dishwasher .#### #### ####[]
And i know i have milk because my breast are starting to hurt .#### #### ####[]
I was also an oversupplier so it took me a really long time to realize my pumping output was slowly decreasing when I switched to these .#### #### ####[]
I like the concept but it 's stupid because if you bend over even slightly , milk pours out completely ...#### #### ####[]
When I open the box 2 of the cups were out of the plastic and had water spots all over them .#### #### ####[]
My nipple goes all the way in and bumps on the plastic wall at the end .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , the chamber of the phalange of the 27mm is SHORTER than the 24mm one which does n't make any sense .#### #### ####[([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
In order to go down on a setting you must first go to the highest setting for it to reset .#### #### ####[]
I suspect the quality might be going down due to so many being given away by insurance companies , but who knows .#### #### ####[]
I used these on my spectra because it was taking 45+ minutes for me to empty .#### #### ####[]
Battery life/charge life , I would charge it fully before every pump session and after a few minute , about 7 - 10 minutes the battery would die .#### #### ####[]

I though I would be hands free and able to go out for a walk when I 'm pumping at work instead of sitting locked in a room .#### #### ####[]
i got to use it for maybe a week and a half before it just stopped working and it won ’ t charge .#### #### ####[]
Cons : the controls are a little strange and takes time to get used to , but once you have a selection you like , then becomes easier .#### #### ####[([3], [7], 'NEG')]
I would only suggest getting a size smaller to fit appropriately .#### #### ####[]

I will never take these to work again , because I ’ m too afraid it will kill my supply .#### #### ####[]
I have had 2 different sets of this brand get cracks in them .#### #### ####[]

I ’ m an oversupplier and can barely get an oz combined using this for 40 minutes .#### #### ####[]

Not a fan to wear it out for work , etc .#### #### ####[]
The power adapter is one of the standard electronic plug ins so I had an extra one that I leave at work and then one I keep at home .#### #### ####[]

I get that with medela in a sitting of 30 minutes .#### #### ####[]
I don ’ t feel like these have great suction , a lot of times they pop off the flange , and every time I pump there is a lot of milk ending up in the back flow protector .#### #### ####[]
The motor strength is great .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS')]
I honestly prefer my medela shields as they fit a lot better than these .#### #### ####[]
They seem to be a bit thicker than they used to be , which is good because they stand up on their own a little better and baby can get more out of them when used for purees .#### #### ####[]
I use the battery pack while traveling .#### #### ####[]
I 'm short , and the bag apparently came to rest on my thigh , and then flattened against it , such that , as it filled , even though the bag was not nearly full , it began to spill milk through the holes in the hard plastic pump part .#### #### ####[]
Switched out membrane still didn ’ t work !#### #### ####[]

I am able to pump so much milk with this pump .#### #### ####[]
Had to cross the straps to keep the back from ridding up , then it also dug into my shoulders .#### #### ####[]
No air loss .. Another plus , of course , less parts to wash !#### #### ####[]
The mechanism for holding the bottles is stable , but it does n't compress the breasts the same as the simple wishes breast , so it feels loose and like I 'm not getting as much production without massage .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [7], 'POS')]

works well for wearing around the house , but will not wear it out .#### #### ####[]
It is NOT always correct , especially if you ’ re moving around , but in the beginning you have to adjust the ounces and it does seem to learn !#### #### ####[]
Screwing the collection bottles in once already in the bra is a pain too .#### #### ####[]
I was able to get it on from the bottom of the flanges where the bottle and flanges meet .#### #### ####[]

works great , went on and purchased the beige after loving the black .. no mom pumping should be expected to sit there and hold the pump against themselves ... i did follow others reviews and went with a L when i usually purchase L- XL and it fits great .#### #### ####[([39], [48, 49], 'POS')]
cons -- -no support , and my breast pads move around alot in it#### #### ####[]
It would normally last for one pump session before needing to be charged , but now the second I unplug it , its bars drop immediately and it dies after using it for a few minutes .#### #### ####[]

You need a tight bra to keep it in place , otherwise it will leak into your shirt .#### #### ####[]

My husband said it sounds like a cat purring .#### #### ####[]
I liked the idea of being able to adjust not just suction strength but the timing too and the description of the gentler `` fluttery motion '' of the S1 .#### #### ####[]
Plus it would start getting really hot and I would have to turn it off for a couple of minutes and restart pumping .#### #### ####[]
It empties me better than my spectra and a lot quicker .#### #### ####[]
And my customers at my job could hear the pump .#### #### ####[]
Major disappointment and only negative thing about this pump is its not portable .#### #### ####[([8], [11, 12], 'NEG')]
Only brand I will use and have n't had any leaks !#### #### ####[]
I also found the edges really sharp and uncomfortable .#### #### ####[([4], [6], 'NEG'), ([4], [8], 'NEG')]
this is way to small for my nipples .#### #### ####[]
This is a huge risk of infection for my baby if I was someone else and still decided to use them 🤮#### #### ####[]
This is much more hygenic .#### #### ####[]
Being that breast milk is a precious commodity and a way I feel my child I can ’ t take the risk of using this product again because of the waste and mess it caused me .#### #### ####[]
They also don ’ t collect as well since the suction breaks .#### #### ####[([10], [11], 'NEG'), ([10], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
I was really hoping to love this pump but unfortunately it just didn ’ t work for me .#### #### ####[]
If you know anything about pouring pumped breastmilk out of storage bags , you 'll agree that it is a huge pain .#### #### ####[]

My husband got the Elvie for me so I don ’ t always need to bring my medela pump with me to all places .#### #### ####[]
JUST worth it because of portability .#### #### ####[]
Apparently the nubs are EXTREMELY fragile .#### #### ####[([2], [5], 'NEG')]
The suction is great if you make sure everything is PERFECTLY aligned .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]
And not so easy to wash .#### #### ####[]
It stretched out pretty quickly such that it does n't really have a tight hold of the pump against my breast , so I still have to keep at least one arm across my chest to create a tighter hold to allow the pump to work most effectively .#### #### ####[]
It fits the Medela PISA parts and bottles .#### #### ####[]
Eventually , my baby will be drinking more than that so I will have to start using two bags per feeding rather than one bag .#### #### ####[]
This was the whole reason I chose the Spectra was so I could take it on the go with me !#### #### ####[]
Love the bra overall , but wish the back clasps weren ’ t broken ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
It is only slightly uncomfortable for me for the first 10 or 20 seconds but not enough to keep me from using it by any means .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s not overly supportive for my DDD cups , and the way it ’ s just smooshes my boobs to the middle giving me uniboob .#### #### ####[]
But I do like how much easier and quicker it is to wash these in the sink vs. something I have to throw in the washer and dryer .#### #### ####[]
The only thing I do n't like so much is that there is always a little bit of food that is left behind in the spout - baby is n't able to suck it out .#### #### ####[]
Some of the reviews said they run big , that 's not true of the set I got .#### #### ####[]
I needed it to be mobile , which is why I was attracted to this pump in the first place .#### #### ####[]
Overall better than using one that is too big .#### #### ####[]
I have searched and searched for tips and tricks and videos on how to make them function better and have come up empty handed every time .#### #### ####[]
The other con is the milk storage bags only hold five oz .#### #### ####[([5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]

When I use with my spectra I will pump between 4-7 ounces on each side ( 8-14 total ) , and with the momcozy the most I have ever gotten is 1.5oz per side .#### #### ####[]
So I looked into it and you have to have everything lined up perfectly , it leaked multiple times after that .#### #### ####[]
This is not helpful when you are testing out the functions and trying to find the right combos .#### #### ####[]

I have lost so much precious breastmilk by using these bags - they crack and break along the seals .#### #### ####[([10], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'NEG')]
Cons : I bought this to pump at work .#### #### ####[]
I pump 6 times a day every day and have been for the last 8 months ( before it was much more frequent ) and I had a single medela pump before which was killer ... it was so time consuming using a single pump and your other breast that is n't being pumped leaks .#### #### ####[]
Pros : It 's super affordable for the price for the suction .#### #### ####[]
I am lucky I have a flexible job and I am able to pump while working on email .#### #### ####[]
But I am desperate to try to keep my milk supply up and pumping is essential for that .#### #### ####[]

The problem I have with this is I leak at random times ( most of the times not a huge quantity but sometimes my whole side of the shirt gets wet ) BUT I ’ m not about to walk around with this in my bra if it has milk in it because the only way to actually save any leakage of milk is if I were to keep it on for hours ... but then the milk won ’ t be any good by the time I accumulate a worthy amount .#### #### ####[]
I constantly am readjusting to get good suction .#### #### ####[]
With another , 6 oz in less time has been better .#### #### ####[]
I got them because they looked more like the original Spectra duckbills than the brand I was using .#### #### ####[]
Also I dropped this thing HARD , straight down on its side on the hard kitchen floor from about four feet up and she did n't skip a beat , still works just as well .#### #### ####[]

I love most that not only do they collect what you leak but for beginning breastfeeders/pumpers when nipples are sensitive this prevents from rubbing inside a bra or getting stuck to a nipple pad .#### #### ####[]

I got this because I exclusively pump and I thought I could pump and do other things at the same time .#### #### ####[]

I have to physically push the flanges closer together so it doesn ’ t pull them further away to a weird angle .#### #### ####[]
Then I got another bag , that one ended up leaking too and I lost an ounce of milk .#### #### ####[]
These do n't work as well as the regular pumps that come with the machine#### #### ####[]
It ’ s basically a glorified sports bra but has zero support and it chafes your skin .#### #### ####[]

I got these as a backup set and for some reason I thought I would try a smaller size .#### #### ####[]
I cant wear it comfortably because the elastic cuts in severely .#### #### ####[]

It is faster , more efficient , quieter , more comfortable than my Medela pump in style that I use with my last child .#### #### ####[]

My IBCLC made it sound like those were not actually common sizes but unfortunately what most pumps come with for whatever reason .#### #### ####[]
Honestly the best time to wear this is if you are breastfeeding outside your comfort zone and instead of the boob leaking all over your clothes you put this on to save the couple drops of milk you spring .#### #### ####[]

Does the job , but not supportive or comfortable .#### #### ####[]
The suckling is so much more comfortable and efficient than my Medela .#### #### ####[([1], [6], 'POS'), ([1], [8], 'POS')]

I used the parts and they worked just like the original spectra .#### #### ####[]
This is my 2nd child and I remember how uncomfortable having something touching my nipples is the first few weeks so I 'm really looking forward to using these after we bring our little home !#### #### ####[]
I have to readjust a few time while pumping and it defeats the whole “ hands free ” thing .#### #### ####[]

Pumping can be challenging and time consuming at work .#### #### ####[([0], [3], 'NEG'), ([0], [5, 6], 'NEG')]

Really frustrating the bags are leaking all the time#### #### ####[([3], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
I had to tape the sides of the bag where the ziplock closure is , for days until I could buy a new box of the same bags from my local Walmart .#### #### ####[]
Way better suction than my medela , and small enough to fit into my diaper bag-instead of having to carry another bag along !#### #### ####[]

First 2 times I used it , it worked great after that this product#### #### ####[]
I had an Elvie with my first son , and my second baby arrived 2 years later and the pump no longer worked .#### #### ####[]
I also like the ability to control suction in both let down mode and `` active '' pumping .#### #### ####[]
It starts making like a weird humming sound when I turn it to the higher suction level .#### #### ####[]
It is uncomfortable and I know from my Ameda that it does n't have to be this clumsy .#### #### ####[]

I love that the with the medela line of pumps you can get all the accessories or extra parts at local stores like target .#### #### ####[]
Great but you sent the wrong size I ordered an XL and received a Large .#### #### ####[]
This product does get the job done but it 's super loud , the battery starts to die fast after a few weeks of having it , and the pumps move if you are moving around to much .#### #### ####[]
The back rode up , and was not supportive .#### #### ####[([1, 2, 3], [7, 8], 'NEG')]

I was hoping maybe I could overfill the reusable containers so I spent even more money buying them but it has a 4oz sensor and it was very messy to empty mid session even after watching YouTube videos and the how to videos .#### #### ####[]

I got this as a more portable option for pumping while at work .#### #### ####[]
I have a medela , but got this to have more convenience for work .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't figure out what broke , but they no longer are air tight and therefore there is no suction .#### #### ####[]
They worked well but trying out another brand to see if I have the same issue with size and collection .#### #### ####[]
I tried them several times and couldn ’ t figure out why they won ’ t working well .#### #### ####[]

But JBL didn ’ t want to make a new ( larger ) battery for the speaker , and they didn ’ t want the new speaker to have a worse battery life than the old one ( 15 hours ) so they just reduced its peak performance .#### #### ####[]

You have to have it really close to you all the time .#### #### ####[]
Good speaker but not as good a bass as the Soundcore#### #### ####[]

Charges USB C , has a headphone jack , has a usb A to charge a phone .#### #### ####[]
This beeping seems to be a common issue .#### #### ####[]
They 're okay for computer speakers and are adequate for near-range listening of fewer than ten feet , but not full enough to use one speaker per area in party mode .#### #### ####[]

With the current outstanding 5 star rating by so many customers and the product description of Loud and Extra Bass , I though I had found the perfect Bluetooth portable speaker at a very acceptable price .#### #### ####[]

They all look the same , they have flashing lights , look gimmicky , and hard to spend that much on a speaker that you will take outside to work , go to the pool , or thrown in the back of the car .#### #### ####[]

I was able to jump our F150 truck battery one time and was amazed .#### #### ####[]
My thought on how these items were suppose to work was first , you charge it up to full capacity , then , when needed to jump start , you hook up the cables to the battery , press a button and the charge would go from the device to the dead battery and provide the 'jump ' , like cables do .#### #### ####[]

i just received my 2000w jumper pack , i went to use it today and upon trying to start a car with a dead battery it would n't recognize it was hooked up to a battery so the green light never came on and the internal relay never tripped to jump start the vehicle , so the jumper failed to work at all .#### #### ####[([45, 46], [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'NEG')]

There was no internal battery in it .#### #### ####[]
Went completely dead after trying to jump start again .#### #### ####[]
similar to other review , giving me a `` red led '' incorrect connection#### #### ####[]

It was so easy to use .#### #### ####[]
As long as you can accept that everything else works perfectly .#### #### ####[]
You could recharge it from the car itself so .#### #### ####[]

The third jump was with the lights , radio and a/c fan on , once connected everything lit up bright and it jumped right off .#### #### ####[]
The three jumps only depleted the charge by one light .#### #### ####[]
Not sure what 's going on but less than six months purchased and two jump starts , and the unit stopped charging .#### #### ####[]
But , I find it extremely annoying that it is not self contained out of the box .#### #### ####[]
I drive a Tundra so these are pretty big tires too .#### #### ####[]

I got this to use with my camera to keep going longer , however just having it on and sitting will drain the battery 50 % in an hour ?#### #### ####[]
I will say , this was a relatively easy test because the battery was just barely low enough not to start .#### #### ####[]
I keep it in a Pelican case to keep it all together and stored which makes it easy to throw in whatever vehicle I 'm in .#### #### ####[]

I have not used the jump box yet , but I did charge multiple devices .#### #### ####[]
Description says 150psi but it broke before it even got to 40psi .#### #### ####[]
It even inflated it from pretty much 0 PSI .#### #### ####[]
I really liked it at first and it works great , but only after a couple months of owning it , it will only hold half a charge .. super frustrating because It ’ s past the return window so I can ’ t get a new one that isn ’ t defect .#### #### ####[]
Finally used a regular battery charger and started my car .#### #### ####[]
A serious limitation the manufacture does not mention .#### #### ####[]
Tried to jump my mower a week later after it had charged fully and it just beeps at me .#### #### ####[]
I only get one jump out of it and it is dead just after a full charge would not recommend to my worst enemy#### #### ####[]
Now I just hook up the unit where ever the car is and power up .#### #### ####[]

I charged the capacitor no problem .#### #### ####[]

So I guess either be sure you have one of these charged or be sure to carry regular ones , too .#### #### ####[]

I then swapped it to the other USB-C port , which after a brief period of fuzzy connection , would then not provide any input signal .#### #### ####[]

Like others said , it makes an audible buzz while running after the first day .#### #### ####[]
I bought because of the quick charge usb port but the first I received I test it with the note 10 plus and did n't work only does cable charging , I receive a replacement same problem I think is just false advertising of quick charge 3.0#### #### ####[]
What really bugs me about this is that if I have 3 or more electronics plugged in , it makes a super annoying whining noise .#### #### ####[]
These do not work all types of WiFi which can make set and management difficult .#### #### ####[]
I disliked hot right the sockets themselves were .#### #### ####[]
I unplugged it and set it aside ... not risking a fire .#### #### ####[]
The next day all the USB ports did not work .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
Instead of taking care of an obviously defective product for a customer who frankly , buys a lot of Anker stuff ... they made it such a hassle to get a `` warranty '' for my brand new charger that I simply returned it to Amazon , and wrote this review .#### #### ####[]
I love the spacing though !#### #### ####[([3], [1], 'POS')]
Ended up having to use double sided tape to get it to mount to the wall .#### #### ####[]
The cord is extremely short so be careful when buying it if you want to have a longer cord .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG')]
Went to use the other one and the power is not coming through to the outlets or usb .#### #### ####[([8], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'NEG')]
I have been greatly inconvenience as my blink is plugged into this and it keeps switch off automatically and comes on back when it wants .#### #### ####[]
I had to duct tape it in order to use it .#### #### ####[]
This worked great for one season of Christmas lights , and one Halloween .#### #### ####[]
I use ty wraps to secure this , which is not all that sturdy a way to mount something like this .#### #### ####[]
It is sealed all around and it was empty !#### #### ####[]
The flaw with this tower is the spacing of the outlet plugs .#### #### ####[([7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [1], 'NEG')]
Nice unit except every time the power goes out the thing doesn ’ t turn back on .#### #### ####[]
It comes with usb ports for phone and other device charging , so you don ’ t need to waste an outlet on them .#### #### ####[]
I do forget though , so it has been on for multiple days without problems .#### #### ####[]
Keeps switching off , wouldn ’ t recommend this product .#### #### ####[]
But it had these different adapters for different places and it did not tell me which ones were for which country .#### #### ####[]
It has three outlets to plug into making it a power strip That can ’ t be used with garden equipments#### #### ####[([10, 11], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'NEG')]
I am trying to prepare for my trip to Europe in two weeks , and this is not helping .#### #### ####[]
But it is not Tuya/Smart Life compatible and only 3 outlets can have smart actions enabled at-a-time .#### #### ####[]
Your larger plug-ins go to the side instead of a long strip .#### #### ####[]
On top of all that none of the USB ports worked , when I tried to reach out to their customer service this Micky dude responded every 4 days .#### #### ####[]
